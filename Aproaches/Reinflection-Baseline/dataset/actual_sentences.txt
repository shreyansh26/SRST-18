# text = Al-Zaman : American forces killed Shaikh Abdullah al-Ani, the preacher at the mosque in the town of Qaim, near the Syrian border.
# text = [This killing of a respected cleric will be causing us trouble for years to come.]
# text = DPA: Iraqi authorities announced that they had busted up 3 terrorist cells operating in Baghdad.
# text = Two of them were being run by 2 officials of the Ministry of the Interior!
# text = The MoI in Iraq is equivalent to the US FBI, so this would be like having J. Edgar Hoover unwittingly employ at a high level members of the Weathermen bombers back in the 1960s.
# text = The third was being run by the head of an investment firm.
# text = You wonder if he was manipulating the market with his bombing targets.
# text = The cells were operating in the Ghazaliyah and al-Jihad districts of the capital.
# text = Although the announcement was probably made to show progress in identifying and breaking up terror cells, I don't find the news that the Baathists continue to penetrate the Iraqi government very hopeful.
# text = It reminds me too much of the ARVN officers who were secretly working for the other side in Vietnam.
# text = Al-Zaman : Guerrillas killed a member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party after kidnapping him in Mosul.
# text = The police commander of Ninevah Province announced that bombings had declined 80 percent in Mosul, whereas there had been a big jump in the number of kidnappings.
# text = On Wednesday guerrillas had kidnapped a cosmetic surgeon and his wife while they were on their way home.
# text = In Suwayrah, Kut Province, two car bombs were discovered before they could be detonated.
# text = (Kut is in southeastern Iraq and has an overwhelmingly Shiite population, who are on the lookout for Baathist saboteurs and willingly turn them in.
# text = This willingness is the main difference in the number of bombings in the south as opposed to the center-north of the country.)
# text = In Baghdad Kadhim Talal Husain, assistant dean at the School of Education at Mustansiriyah University, was assassinated with his driver in the Salikh district.
# text = Guerrillas killed an engineer, Asi Ali, from Tikrit.
# text = They also killed Shaikh Hamid 'Akkab, a clan elder of a branch of the Dulaim tribe in Tikrit.
# text = His mother was also killed in the attack.
# text = Two other Dulaim leaders have been killed in the past week and a half.
# text = Guerrillas near Hawijah launched an attack that left 6 dead, including 4 Iraqi soldiers.
# text = One of them was from the Jubur tribe and was deputy commander of the Hawijah garrison.
# text = Two hundred members of the Batawi clan of the Dulaim demonstrated in Baghdad on Friday, protesting the killing of their clan elder, Shaikh Kadhim Sarhid and 4 of his sons, by gunmen wearing Iraqi army uniforms.
# text = (This is a largely Sunni Arab clan, and some Sunni observers have accused Shiite elements in the government of being behind the assassination; it is more likely the work of Sunni Arab guerrillas punishing the Batawi leaders for cooperating with the Dec. 15 elections.)
# text = Al-Zaman : The Iraqi High Electoral Commission on Friday denied a request of the Debaathification Commission to exclude 51 individuals from running on party lists in the Dec. 15 elections on grounds of having been sufficiently involved in Baath activities to warrant their being excluded from civil office.
# text = The Commission said it had no legal grounds for such an exclusion.
# text = This item is a small one and easily missed.
# text = But in my view it is highly significant.
# text = The Debaathification Commission had been pushed by Ahmad Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress very hard, and had pushed many Sunni Arabs into the arms of the guerrillas.
# text = Chalabi has been increasingly marginalized within Iraq, however, despite his ties of clientelage with Washington and Tehran.
# text = He is no longer in the dominant Shiite list, the United Iraqi Alliance, and won't have many seats in the new parliament.
# text = Some 2,000 junior officers of the old Baath army have been recalled to duty in recent months, something Chalabi would have blocked if he could have.
# text = Now the Electoral Commission is refusing to punish people for mere past Baath Party membership.
# text = The situation in Iraq is only going to get better this way.
# text = If someone committed a crime against humanity, prosecute the person.
# text = If he or she did not, then they should have all the same rights as other Iraqis.
# text = Al-Sharq al-Awsat reports that a key eyewitness in the trial of Saddam Hussein for a 1982 massacre at Dujail has died.
# text = A team from the court managed to take his deposition before he died.
# text = The trial begins again Nov.28.
# text = In Baghdad the fighting still continues in several areas, mostly in Sadr city and Adhamiya.
# text = Baghdadis don't venture much out of their neighbourhoods any more, you never know where you might get stuck.
# text = There has been talk that the night curfew might be implemented again.
# text = My neighbourhood has been surrounded by American troops for three days now, helicopters have been circling over our heads non-stop.
# text = Fedayeen are now visible on the street and they have become bolder than ever.
# text = Yesterday there were tens of them putting road blocks on our street and setting up mortars, they only come out in the open when Americans leave the area, then they start firing mortars indiscriminately and shooting their AK-47's in the air.
# text = They are setting the road blocks at the exact same positions they were during the war last year, which indicates they are the same people.
# text = And there is nothing we can do about it really, people who are suggesting that we go out and fight them are living in dream land.
# text = Even the IP and ICDC have abandoned the neighbourhood, and those are trained and armed, so don't expect scared civilians to do anything except to hide inside and pray a helicopter or a tank doesn't bomb them, and also how are American soldiers going to distinguish the brave and valiant civilians from the Fedayeen?
# text = Everyone is apprehensive, there is some talk that April 9th and 10th are going to be bloody days.
# text = Most people haven't gone to work the last few days, although it seems that the rest of Baghdad is 'normal' (if you can define what normal is).
# text = There are rumours about preparations by slum dwellers for another looting spree against banks, governmental and public property similar to the one that took place last April, and I have already overheard youngsters in my neighbourhood joking about it and saying things like "This time we will be the first to loot, we didn't get anything the last time".
# text = Mosques are calling for donating blood, food, and medicine for Fallujah, and several convoys have already headed out for Fallujah, most of them returned later though.
# text = What irritates me is this sudden false 'solidarity' between Sunni and Shi'ite clerics, we all know that they would be glad to get at each others throats when they have the chance, and Shia clerics were describing Fallujan insurgents as 'Ba'athists', 'Saddamites', 'Wahhabis', and 'terrorists' just a few days ago.
# text = So what happened?
# text = I guess it's just the old new Arab 'Me against my brother, me and my brother against my cousin, me and my cousin against my enemy', or 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend' thing going on again.
# text = Speaking of Fallujah, we have only Al-Jazeera to rely on for our news from there.
# text = They have sent over their top reporter Ahmed Mansour to the town, and he is spouting all kinds of propaganda hourly reminding me of Al-Sahhaf.
# text = "They are targetting ambulances", "American snipers are shooting children and pregnant women", and "They are using cluster bombs against civilians" is all you get to hear from him.
# text = He did once make an unforgivable error when he mentioned that Fallujan militants were shooting at the Marines from the roofs of mosques and houses in Hay Al-Golan, but of course that is okay for Al-Jazeera.
# text = Someone who called himself Abu Hafs from the Ibn Al-Khattab Brigades (another new group) was on Al-Jazeera describing the enormous casualties among the Marines and he sweared that American soldiers were mutilating the bodies of dead insurgents.
# text = Al-Iraqiyah tv said that ICDC were controlling Ramadi.
# text = Azzaman newspaper mentioned an announcement signed by Abdul Aziz bin Muqrin, an Al-Qaeda operative in Saudi Arabia on an Islamic website 'the voice of Jihad', in which he stated that "although mutilating dead bodies is not originally permitted in Islam, but in this case it is allowed if Muslims use it against infidels to deter them from committing criminal actions".
# text = He added that "America does not understand anything except the language of force and retaliation, they were kicked out of Somalia in humiliation after that soldier was dragged in Mogadishu for the whole world to see", and that "the day will come when the dead bodies of Americans and Jews would be dragged, defiled, and stepped on in the Arabian peninsula together with their agents and supporters".
# text = Elena's motorcycle tour through the region around Chernobyl has revived interest in one of the most serious nuclear disasters in history.
# text = We all know what happened, but even to this day, there are many different versions and opinions on how it happened and what effect Chernobyl will have on the health of people affected by the fallout.
# text = UPDATE:
# text = Now you can tour Chernobyl and write your own story.
# text = This is not a post about fault-finding or assigning blame.
# text = It is a time to learn what happened and how it may affect the future.
# text = There was a soothing authoritative UNSCEAR (United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation ) report in 2000 on the health effects of Chernobyl confirming that there was no scientific evidence of any significant radiation-related health effects to most people exposed.
# text = This was heavily promoted by the Australasian Radiation Protection Society in a press release titled THE MYTHS OF CHERNOBYL which contained the following:
# text = One of the most widespread myths of recent times is that the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in 1986 caused many thousands of extra cancer deaths in neighbouring regions, and that public health has been severely affected by exposure to radiation.
# text = Many people still believe that to be true, even though the Ministry of Russian Federation on Civil Defence, Emergencies and Elimination of Conseguences of Natural Disasters (EMERCOM of Russia) reported this in 1996:
# text = CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT: TEN YEARS ON
# text = In the last decade, there has been a real and significant increase in childhood and, to a certain extent, adult carcinoma of the thyroid in contaminated regions of the former Soviet Union (Wi940) which should be attributed to the Chernobyl accident until proven otherwise.
# text = The prestigious IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) published an early report on Chernobyl which was based on information from Russian sources and stated that there was no significant health effects.
# text = However, in April 2001, the IAEA published Fifteen Years after the Chernobyl Accident - Lessons learned. which contradict the earlier reports.
# text = Here are some excerpts:
# text = The dramatic increase in radiation-induced thyroid cancers in children and adolescents in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, which have been observed since 1991, continues to this day.
# text = ...a drop in the birth rate, a deterioration in women's reproductive health, an increase in complications during pregnancy and birth, and a deterioration in neonatal health....
# text = The dynamics of change in the state of health of children affected by the Chernobyl accident in all three countries - Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine - in the post-accident period is characterized by persistent negative tendencies: the morbidity rate is going up, the number of really healthy children is dropping, and disability is increasing .
# text = As a parent, I can well imagine how painful it must be for those families whose children are succumbing to radiation poisoning.
# text = There is a lot to learn about Chernobyl.
# text = Being well-informed will give you certainty and that is desirable in a world of conflicting reports.
# text = There are a wealth of references on Chernobyl.
# text = Read some of the following links and draw your own conclusions.
# text = These links present the many viewpoints that existed and still exist about the disaster called Chernobyl:

# text = I would be interested in hearing what conclusions you reached and what you found that was most convincing.
# text = radiation:
# text = As a child in the 50's I had a lot of glandular problems and they treated it with radiation therapy (primitive at best!) and stopped when a lesion on my neck started enlarging--they said it was not CA but stopped the treatments....
# text = Remember the old shoe sizing machines that was a form of radiation xray?
# text = That too was stopped.
# text = Don't have to mention what radiation has done and is still doing to Hirsohima & Nagaski folks--there can be no doubts about the effects of radiation in Chernobyl.......
# text = The Chernobyl Children's Project (http://www.adiccp.org/home/default.asp) offers several ways to help the children of that region.
# text = One of them is the Rest and Recuperation Program, wherein a child can come to the US for a few weeks in the summer.
# text = Even a little time spent receiving wholesome, uncontaminated food, good medical care, etc. can add years to their lives.
# text = S. and I have an acquaintance who has hosted several of these children for many years; to see these little ones breaks the heart.
# text = The urge to protect and gather them all in is almost overwhelming, and makes me more grateful for the blessings I have.
# text = Take care, my friend, Linda
# text = I'm sorry to say Elena's story has been revealed to be a fake.
# text = What do the new al-Qaeda videotape and audio speeches of Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri tell us about the hopes of the remaining top leadership of the organization?
# text = Because the US and Pakistan have managed to capture or kill about 2/3s of the top 25 al-Qaeda commanders, the middle managers are not in close contact with al-Zawahiri and Bin Laden.
# text = The tape was a way to signal priorities.
# text = These are 1) Assassinate or overthrow Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistani military "president" who had made a coup in 1999 and has thrown in his lot with the United States against the Taliban and al-Qaeda.
# text = Musharraf has been trying to purge his officer corps of the substantial number of al-Qaeda sympathizers.
# text = His military intelligence has captured major figures like Abu Zubayda and Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, as well as nearly 500 other al-Qaeda operatives, over 400 of whom the Pakistanis have turned over to the US.
# text = Musharraf held elections in October of 2002, in which center-right parties did well, but in which nearly 20 percent of parliament seats went to the fundamentalist religious party coalition, MMA.
# text = MMA also captured the Northwest Frontier Province, which probably shelters Bin Laden and al-Zawahiri, and is in a joint government of Baluchistan Province, also on the Afghanistan border.
# text = If al-Qaeda can kill Musharraf or instigate a military coup against him by Islamist junior officers, they can hope to catapult the MMA to power as political allies and hosts.
# text = They would thereby gain control of a major base for terrorist operations, which is also a nuclear power.
# text = All this is highly unlikely, as with most al-Qaeda crackpot schemes.
# text = But so was it unlikely that a small group of Arab mujahidin would virtually take over Afghanistan.
# text = Response: The US must do whatever it can to strengthen the legitimacy of the Pakistani government.
# text = On the one hand, it should pressure Musharraf to take off his uniform and run for president in a fair election, and to repeal the contentious "Legal Framework Order" that essentially perpetuates his dictatorship.
# text = On the other, restrictions should be lifted on the mainstream Muslim League-N and Pakistan People's Party, who can defeat the MMA in fair elections if not hogtied by the secret police.
# text = On the other hand, the US should strong-arm India and Pakistan into a final settlement of the Kashmir issue.
# text = Al-Zawahiri attempted to use Musharraf's lack of progress in helping the Muslims of that Indian state as a justification for his overthrow.
# text = The Kashmir issue generates far more terrorism, and even the threat of nuclear war, than Iraq ever did.
# text = 2) Target Israel and encourage the worst elements of the Palestinians by playing on the iron fist policies of the Sharon government.
# text = Response: The US has succeeded in politically isolating Hamas, and started the process of cutting off its funding.
# text = This terrorist organization can now only pull off far less sophisticated bombings and attacks.
# text = It should continue to be defanged.
# text = But Sharon's iron fist is simply not working as a means of establishing general peace, and the Bush administration will have to finally apply effective pressure on Sharon to stop his outrages in and colonization of the West Bank and Gaza.
# text = Sharon's hard line has worked in tandem with Hamas's terrorism to ratchet up tensions further and further, which spill over into the Muslim world and serve as a recruiting tool for al-Qaeda in its search for agents willing to hit the United States.
# text = Israel owes the United States at least this much, in this crisis, to cease militarily unnecessary provocations and establish genuine peace.
# text = 3) Make Iraq another Afghanistan, using the Republican Right's own tactics against them.
# text = Response: Iraq is actually hostile territory for al-Qaeda, and without Iraqi sympathizers it cannot succeed there.
# text = By moving quickly to Iraqi sovereignty and improvement of Iraqi lives, the US may be able to get Iraqis on its side, so that they turn in the foreigners.
# text = Certainly, the Shiites already hate al-Qaeda and would help; likewise the Kurds.
# text = The problem of mollifying the Sunnis, though, has to be solved to avoid giving al-Qaeda an entrée.
# text = The Americans have to put away their free-market fetishism for a while and find ways of creating jobs and pumping money into Iraqi households.
# text = We need an FDR in Iraq, not a Ronald Reagan.
# text = Of course, the sooner the US soldiers can be withdrawn in favor of less-provocative local or international forces, the better.
# text = Getting the Spanish out of Iraq isn't nearly as good a rallying cry for al-Qaeda in the Arab world as getting the Americans and British out.
# text = The thing to keep in mind is that Sunni Arab nationalists and Baathists and local Sunni radicals are likely to remain far more dangerous to the US in Iraq than al-Qaeda infiltrators, and it would be dangerous to take one's eyes off the former ball.
# text = George W. Bush alleged Thursday that John Edwards lacks the experience necessary to be president.
# text = The problem with this argument is that Bush lacked the experience necessary to be president when he ran in 2000, so this sort of cheap shot just hoists him by his own petard.
# text = Let's just remember a seminal Bush moment in 1999:
# text = ' Bush fails reporter's pop quiz on international leaders
# text = November 5, 1999
# text = Web posted at: 3:29 p.m. EST (2029 GMT)
# text = WASHINGTON (CNN) --
# text = Texas Gov. George W. Bush is enduring sharp criticism for being unable to name the leaders of four current world hot spots, but President Bill Clinton says Bush "should, and probably will, pick up" those names.
# text = The front-runner for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination faltered Thursday in an international affairs pop quiz posed by Andy Hiller, a political reporter for WHDH-TV in Boston.
# text = Bush
# text = Hiller asked Bush to name the leaders of Chechnya, Taiwan, India and Pakistan.
# text = Bush was only able to give a partial response to the query on the leader of Taiwan, referring to Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui simply as "Lee."
# text = He could not name the others.
# text = "Can you name the general who is in charge of Pakistan?"
# text = Hiller asked, inquiring about Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, who seized control of the country October 12.
# text = "Wait, wait, is this 50 questions?" asked Bush.
# text = Hiller replied: "No, it's four questions of four leaders in four hot spots." . . .
# text = It appears this guy is going to bring stability to the country and I think that's good news for the subcontinent."
# text = Gore released a statement Friday taking Bush to task for his comments on Pakistan's recent coup.
# text = "I find it troubling that a candidate for president in our country -- the world's oldest democracy -- would characterize the military takeover as "good news," Gore said.
# text = "Further, I find it even more disturbing that he made these comments about a nation that just last year tested nuclear weapons -- shortly after voicing his public opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
# text = A spokesman for President Clinton also criticized Bush's comments.
# text = "It is very dangerous for this country to condone the overthrow of democratically elected governments," said David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council.
# text = Not only did Bush not know who General Pervez Musharraf was, he seems to have confused coup-making with "taking office," and moreover went on to suggest that the overthrow of an elected prime minister and the installation in power of the Pakistan military, then the world's strongest supporter of the Taliban, would bring "stability!"
# text = Musharraf made his coup in part because of the military's anger over Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's willingness to back down from confronting India over Kashmir, so that he explicitly came to power as a warmonger.
# text = I can't tell you how ominous I found Bush's performance in that interview.
# text = I still remember him stuttering about "the General," unable to remember Musharraf's name.
# text = He obviously had no idea what he was talking about, though he demonstrated a number of ill-fated instincts.
# text = He obviously liked authoritarian rule better than democracy, equating dictatorship with "stability."
# text = And, he didn't think he needed to know anything about South Asia, with its nuclear giants and radical religious politics--the latter a dire security threat to the US.
# text = He couldn't tell when things were becoming more unstable as opposed to less.
# text = Musharraf went on to play nuclear brinkmanship with India in 2002, risking war twice that year.
# text = Although Musharraf did turn against the Taliban after September 11, under extreme duress from the US, elements of his military continued to support radical Islamism and have recently been implicated in assassination attempts on Musharraf himself.
# text = This was the body that Bush proclaimed was bringing "stability" to the region in fall of 1999.
# text = So, one answer to Bush's charge about Edwards is that if it had any merit, Bush should have declined to run himself.
# text = Another answer is that Edwards certainly knows far more about foreign affairs now than Bush did then.
# text = Indeed, given how Bush has rampaged around the world alienating allies and ignoring vital conflicts with the potential to blow back on the US, one might well argue that Edwards knows more now than Bush does.
# text = This is what Edwards' campaign literature said about his positions: "Edwards believes that the U.S. must be an active leader to help resolve conflicts, from reducing tensions between India and Pakistan to the peace process in Northern Ireland.
# text = Edwards is a strong supporter of Israel, and believes that the U.S. has a vital role in promoting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians."
# text = I don't see Bush doing any of this.
# text = From Friday's Daily Star
# text = By Juan Cole
# text = Friday, June 04, 2004
# text = As the American public gradually wearies of the Iraq crisis, some have begun worrying that the war could blow back on the US by creating the conditions for anti-American terrorism.
# text = Israel, however, is much closer to Iraq and is likely to suffer from Iraqi instability much more acutely than will the United States.
# text = Ironically, among the strongest proponents of war in Iraq were Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his neoconservative supporters in the US.
# text = Have they, however, actually weakened Israeli security?
# text = The biggest threat Israel faces is not from conventional armies but from the asymmetrical tactics of Palestinian national liberation movements.
# text = The derailing of the Oslo peace process by the hard-line policies of Sharon and the Palestinian intifada has encouraged suicide bombings.
# text = This, in turn, has discouraged international investment in Israel and has made it less likely that immigrants to the country will actually remain there.
# text = Although Israel withdrew from Lebanese territory in May 2000, the radical Lebanese Shiite party, Hizbullah, has not been mollified.
# text = It is estimated to have some 5,000 armed fighters, and they have pursued attacks against Israeli forces to compel them to withdraw from the Shebaa Farms, a sliver of Syrian territory that Israel annexed after the 1967 war.
# text = Any thorough assessment of the impact of the Iraq war and its aftermath on Israel's security environment must, therefore, closely examine its likely effect on the conduct of asymmetrical warfare.
# text = Although it is often alleged (without much evidence) that Saddam Hussein gave money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers and so encouraged asymmetrical warfare, it is not clear that he actually posed a danger to Israel.
# text = The Palestinians who have been willing to kill themselves to end the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were not driven by economic considerations.
# text = Saddam never did anything practical to help the Palestinians.
# text = At some points, as in the late 1980s, he reportedly made behind-the-scenes overtures to the Israelis to arrive at some sort of a deal.
# text = He did not allow Palestinian radicals to launch operations against Israel from Iraq.
# text = By the late 1990s, Iraq had no nuclear or biological weapons program, and had destroyed its chemical weapons stockpiles.
# text = Its ramshackle army had virtually collapsed before the American invasion in 2003.
# text = If it is hard to see how Baathist Iraq posed any real threat to Israel, it is not so difficult to see a menace in the current instability.
# text = The bungling of post-war Iraq by the Bush administration created a weak and failed state.
# text = Armed militias, many staffed by former Iraqi military men with substantial training and experience, have proliferated.
# text = The US chose to ally itself with such groups as the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, whose 15,000-strong Badr Corps paramilitary was trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.
# text = Anti-Israeli and pro-Palestinian feeling is strong among several major Iraqi ideological groups and currents.
# text = The more radical Shiites, who generally follow the theocratic notions of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, routinely chant and demonstrate against Israel.
# text = They vehemently protested the Israeli assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the leader of Hamas, last March.
# text = Worse for Israel, the assassination drew a denunciation even from the moderate and cautious Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, who wields enormous moral authority over Iraqi Shiites.
# text = These Shiite movements had been suppressed by Saddam Hussein's regime, but have now organized and armed themselves.
# text = They have also reestablished their historical links with Lebanese and Iranian Shiites.
# text = It is inevitable that most Iraqi Shiites will side with their Hizbullah coreligionists against Israel, and it seems likely that Iraqi Shiites will get rich enough from Iraqi petroleum sales in the future that they will be in a good position to bankroll Lebanese Shiite radicals.
# text = Sunni Arab fundamentalists deeply sympathize with the Palestinians and with Hamas, and those in Iraq have deep historical inks with fundamentalists in Jordan and Palestine.
# text = Iraqi cities such as Fallujah and Ramadi were on the truck route from Amman to Baghdad, and so came under the influence of the Salafi movement, which is popular in Jordan.
# text = Secular Arab nationalist groups also universally sympathize with the Palestinians, and those in post-Saddam Iraq are no exception.
# text = Whereas Saddam Hussein's dictatorship ensured that such populist currents were kept firmly under control, they are now free to organize.
# text = An Iraq in which armed fundamentalist and nationalist militias proliferate is inevitably a security worry for Israel.
# text = If even a modicum of normality and security can be returned to Iraq, its citizens will be able to benefit from the country's petroleum reserves.
# text = That private wealth can easily be funneled into aid for the Palestinians and for Lebanese Shiites.
# text = Israel's security interests are best served by peace with its neighbors, which can only be achieved by trading land for peace with the Palestinians.
# text = Ariel Sharon's aggressive near annexation of almost half of the occupied West Bank and his indefinite postponement of any Palestinian state have created unprecedented rage and violence.
# text = The anger has spread throughout the Muslim world, including Iraq.
# text = The promotion by the pro-Zionist right of twin occupations - in the West Bank and in Iraq - has profoundly weakened, not strengthened, Israeli security.
# text = Juan Cole (www.juancole.com) is a professor of modern Middle East history at the University of Michigan and author of "Sacred Space and Holy War" (I.B. Tauris, 2002).
# text = THE DAILY STAR publishes this commentary in agreement with Agence Global
# text = Tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between India and Sri Lanka would encourage Sinhala rulers to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace process
# text = But there are strong hints in the country that a new Indo-Sri Lanka defense deal could be in the making.
# text = And this has already drawn protests from the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) which was backed by the LTTE in the April general elections held in Sri Lanka.
# text = Apart from the 1,200 Indian lives lost in 1987, the Indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the Sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country's sovereignty.
# text = India defensive over Sri Lanka
# text = By Ranjit Devraj
# text = NEW DELHI -
# text = While India is ready to enter into a "defense cooperation agreement" with Sri Lanka, it is wary of being drawn into any military involvement in the island nation's two decades-old civil war that has seen violent strife between ethnic Tamils and the Sinhalese majority - leaving over 60,000 dead on both sides.
# text = And that explains the delay in the signing of a formal defense agreement that was at the heart of Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga's four-day visit to India recently.
# text = According to Professor S D Muni, South Asia expert at the Jawaharal Nehru University, the two-year peace talks between Colombo and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are stalemated.
# text = For that reason, he said, Kumaratunga's government was keen to beef up military preparedness with Indian support.
# text = "The Sri Lankan government does not want to initiate a conflict but would be interested in deterring the LTTE from starting one.
# text = And the Tigers look as if they are on the brink of launching another offensive," Muni told IPS.
# text = Colombo held six rounds of talks with the Tigers between September 2002 and March 2003.
# text = But last April, the rebels abruptly pulled out of negotiations demanding recognition, first, for the right to self-rule before proceeding any further.
# text = Kumaratunga's India tour preceded a three-day visit to Sri Lanka by Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen in a new bid to revive the peace talks that were supposed to follow a ceasefire that Oslo successfully brokered in February 2002.
# text = Petersen held discussions with both Kumaratunga and the reclusive LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran in the rebel stronghold of Kilinochchi without success, and chief Tamil rebel negotiator Anton Balasingham and Norwegian envoy Erik Solheim held closed-door talks at the international airport late Saturday in an effort to keep the salvage effort on track, diplomatic sources said.
# text = But they, too, failed.
# text = Colombo, too, seems to be in an intractable position.
# text = According to former Indian army general A S Kalkat, the difficulty for Kumaratunga's government lay in the fact that the LTTE had become a de jure power in the north and east of the island and was running every aspect of civil administration in the areas within its control.
# text = A veteran of India's military intervention in the Jaffna peninsula to help implement the 1987 Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord - which ambitiously provided for the disarming of the formidable LTTE - Kalkat said the new defense deal would essentially be a reiteration of the older one minus its military commitment.
# text = Kalkat, who currently chairs the independent US-based International Council on Conflict Resolution, said despite the failure of the Indian army to disarm or even subdue the Tigers, India remained the only power capable of influencing the course of the current peace talks.
# text = "The Norwegians mean well but their role is limited to that of honest broker and the LTTE is keenly aware that they do not have the power [unlike India] to underwrite any arrangement," Kalkat told IPS in an interview.
# text = In 1987, the Tamil Tigers reluctantly accepted the peace accord under Indian pressure.
# text = Under the accord, a new northeastern provincial council was formed and the Indian army was deployed as peacekeepers in the north and east.
# text = However, differences between India and LTTE soon surfaced and led to clashes between Tiger guerrillas and the Indian peace keeping force.
# text = About 1,200 Indian soldiers were killed during this phase of the conflict.
# text = India had to pull back its forces from Sri Lanka in 1989 following the election of Ranasinghe Premadasa, a strong critic of Indian mediation.
# text = Last June, an international initiative led by Japan to persuade the LTTE to come back to the negotiating table failed despite an aid package offer of US$4.5 billion.
# text = Japan's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, who called for tangible progress in the peace process before the money would be released, came back from visits to Colombo and Kilinochchi in early November a frustrated man.
# text = He complained about the "visible lack of progress" and reaching an impasse in talks with both sides.
# text = The Tigers' chief ideologue, Balasingham, sniffed at the proposal saying that "a solution to the ethnic conflict cannot be predetermined by the resolutions or declarations of donor conferences, but has to be negotiated by the parties in conflict without the constraints of external forces."
# text = But there are strong hints in the country that a new Indo-Sri Lanka defense deal could be in the making.
# text = And this has already drawn protests from the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) which was backed by the LTTE in the April general elections held in Sri Lanka.
# text = "Tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between India and Sri Lanka would encourage Sinhala rulers to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace process," TNA member of parliament P Sithamparanathan was quoted as saying in a statement.
# text = She added that recent visits to the island by India's top military brass including army chief General Nirmal Chander Vij have "caused apprehension among Tamils that preparations are under way for another war in the island".
# text = But Kalkat pointed out that India would be ill-advised to be involved again, militarily, with Sri Lanka if only because it still had to consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic Tamils in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu - separated from Sri Lanka's Jaffna peninsula by the narrow Palk Straits.
# text = Apart from the 1,200 Indian lives lost in 1987, the Indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the Sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country's sovereignty.
# text = The best option, now, under the present difficult circumstances is for Colombo to do its own dirty work, although New Delhi can always be counted on to render good neighborly help because of the shared belief that religion, ethnicity and language cannot be the basis for secession.
# text = In any case, Kalkat puts it succinctly: "There cannot be a military option to what is a political situation."

# text = Unreported by the international media, the Valley of Kashmir has seen an ethnic and cultural genocide that has resulted in the fleeing from the valley of almost all the Hindu families who have been living there since human habitation was first recorded.
# text = Thus far, none of the many "human rights" busybodies across the world have bothered to even notice such a development.
# text = Musharraf calls the bluff
# text = M.D. Nalapat
# text = While most U.S. secretaries of state -- save perhaps Dean Rusk -- have gobbled up credit for outcomes that they had little to do with, few have been as brazen as Colin Powell.
# text = Two years ago, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was surprised when the leader of the main Islamist alliance -- Maulana Fazlur Rahman -- visited India and issued a series of highly conciliatory statements.
# text = As Pakistan's president had been telling the United States he was "forced" into taking a hawkish line on India precisely by the likes of Rahman, this was an embarrassment.
# text = The reality is that India is no longer the enemy of choice for the people of Pakistan.
# text = That distinction has now gone to the United States.
# text = Realists, and this even includes members of the U.S. Democratic foreign policy establishment such as Strobe Talbott, who have long sought to divest India of its defensive capability against another nuclear power in Asia, understand the only feasible solution for Kashmir is the acceptance of the status quo.
# text = India keeps what it has while Pakistan and China (which was gifted a slice of the territory three decades ago) do likewise.
# text = Simultaneously, New Delhi would ensure a degree of autonomy for the state that would help cut popular support off from jihadis attempting to convert Kashmir into a second Afghanistan.
# text = Bill Clinton understood this at the end of his term in office yet, under Colin Powell (who appears to have an affinity for generals active in politics), the pendulum of U.S. policy has once again swung toward a quixotic effort to prize at least the Valley of Kashmir loose from India.
# text = This, Pakistan's lobbyist in Washington Christina Rocca has been told, is the "minimum" that the Pakistan army will accept.
# text = It is also far more than what any administration in New Delhi can deliver.
# text = This writer has for years regarded the best solution to the Kashmir problem as being the trifurcation of the Indian part of the state into a Hindu-majority Jammu, a Buddhist-dominated Ladakh and the overwhelmingly Muslim Kashmir Valley, with the third state given little of taxpayers' money but substantial autonomy.
# text = With luck, the Kashmir Valley can attract investment from the Middle East and other locations where Muslims are dominant and become a tourist, education and services haven within India.
# text = The overwhelming majority of Muslims in Kashmir would be happy with such an outcome, except for the tiny jihadi segment patronized by the U.S. State Department and the Pakistan Army, which would like to even the score with India for their catastrophic defeat in Bangladesh in 1971.
# text = Unreported by the international media, the Valley of Kashmir has seen an ethnic and cultural genocide that has resulted in the fleeing from the valley of almost all the Hindu families who have been living there since human habitation was first recorded.
# text = Thus far, none of the many "human rights" busybodies across the world have bothered to even notice such a development.
# text = Indeed, their reports are filled with tales of the "atrocities" of Indian troops on the innocent jihadis.
# text = Despite Sept. 11, the United States still supports the Kashmir groups that back jihad as part of the price Washington is paying to keep Pervez Musharraf happy.
# text = Unfortunately for them, the general has decided to take seriously Colin Powell's frequent boasts that it was on his nudging that the Indians made conciliatory gestures toward Islamabad.
# text = The U.S. State Department and the misnamed think tanks that follow its lead have held numerous conferences on Kashmir and, in most of them, the solution that has emerged is a valley prized loose from Indian control and under its own version of Ibrahim Rugova.
# text = That India is not Yugoslavia and that the "foreigner-led" Indian National Congress can least afford to ignore Indian nationalism, has not struck the conferees, among whom have been several Indian "scholars" and "analysts" ready to say and endorse anything for the sake of a free trip to New York or Vienna.
# text = Despite many wrinkles, India remains a part-democracy and merely signing on to a piece of paper that calls for an independent Kashmir does not get you into the trouble that writing an op-ed piece against Sonia Gandhi or Atal Behari Vajpayee would instantly.
# text = It was the business community in India that stepped in after Vajpayee indulged in an empty bout of saber rattling in 2002, pointing out that the only beneficiary of the mythical perception that war -- especially nuclear war -- was around the corner in the subcontinent was China.
# text = The reason for this is that India is emerging as an alternative investment destination to China, hence the favor that the generals in Islamabad do to their trusty supplier of nukes and missiles by creating a scare about war involving India when in fact the real flashpoints are the Taiwan Straits and North Korea.
# text = Since then, India has talked peace while always signaling that only the status quo would be acceptable as a final settlement: a line of action that is followed in the case of disputes with China as well.
# text = Unfortunately for those eager to indefinitely carry on with the lucrative business of conflict resolution in South Asia, Pervez Musharraf has now called Colin Powell's bluff, challenging him to deliver on his frequent statements implying that the Indians jump to his commands.
# text = Once the Manmohan Singh government shows that it has little appetite for suicide, Musharraf will face the moment of truth: accept the inevitable, or once again ramp up the insurgency and spawn a fresh lot of killers that can hit not merely Mumbai and New Delhi but London and Chicago as well.
# text = The one country that has shown that it understands the realities in South Asia is China.
# text = Under President Hu Jintao, Beijing has opened out to New Delhi and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is expected to visit early next year, making friends by formally accepting Sikkim as part of India and backing India as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council -- thus leaving Washington as the only one of the "permanent five" that has not yet done so.
# text = With Colin Powell around, the U.S. has no need of an Osama bin Laden
# text = M.D. Nalapat, an expert on jihad, is professor of geopolitics at the Manipal Academy of Higher Education, India.
# text = Washington Times 28/10/2004
# text = Ok.
# text = We all know that John Kerry served in Vietnam.
# text = Four whole months, after which he took advantage of a little-known, little-invoked regulation that allowed him to desert his "band of brothers".
# text = We also know how Dan Rather libeled George Bush and impugned his service in the Texas Air National Guard on a "60 Minutes II" report based largely on forged documents.
# text = During his time in the Guard, George Bush flew the F-102 Delta Dagger fighter-interceptor.
# text = The F-102 saw service in the Vietnam theater between March 1962 and December 1969.
# text = During this time, F-102 squadrons were based out of Tan Son Nhut, Da Nang and Bien Hoa in Vietnam, and Udorn and Don Muang in Thailand.
# text = ( Click here for source. )
# text = As far as George Bush knew, he and his unit could have been transferred to Vietnam.
# text = In all this so-called controversy, has anyone considered that perhaps George Bush just wanted to fly jets?
# text = And, let's remember, flying supersonic fighter jets is dangerous!
# text = They don't let just anybody do it.
# text = Some reporters (you know, the ones with journalistic ethics) have actually uncovered the truth about George Bush's service in the Texas Air National Guard.
# text = For example, did you know that George Bush spent considerably more time in uniform than John Kerry?
# text = What follows is the text of an e-mail sent to me by a friend of mine (thanks to Dave Manzano).
# text = Read on to learn the facts.
# text = ---------
# text = Bush’s National Guard years
# text = Before you fall for Dems’ spin, here are the facts
# text = What do you really know about George W. Bush’s time in the Air National Guard?
# text = That he didn’t show up for duty in Alabama?
# text = That he missed a physical?
# text = That his daddy got him in?
# text = News coverage of the president’s years in the Guard has tended to focus on one brief portion of that time — to the exclusion of virtually everything else.
# text = So just for the record, here, in full, is what Bush did:
# text = The future president joined the Guard in May 1968.
# text = Almost immediately, he began an extended period of training.
# text = Six weeks of basic training.
# text = Fifty-three weeks of flight training.
# text = Twenty-one weeks of fighter-interceptor training.
# text = That was 80 weeks to begin with, and there were other training periods thrown in as well.
# text = It was full-time work.
# text = By the time it was over, Bush had served nearly two years.
# text = Not two years of weekends.
# text = Two years.
# text = After training, Bush kept flying, racking up hundreds of hours in F-102 jets.
# text = As he did, he accumulated points toward his National Guard service requirements.
# text = At the time, guardsmen were required to accumulate a minimum of 50 points to meet their yearly obligation.
# text = According to records released earlier this year, Bush earned 253 points in his first year, May 1968 to May 1969 (since he joined in May 1968, his service thereafter was measured on a May-to-May basis).
# text = Bush earned 340 points in 1969-1970.
# text = [In other words, Bush earned enough points to satisfy the requirements for his entire six year hitch in 1969-1970 alone.
# text = - acd]
# text = He earned 137 points in 1970-1971.
# text = And he earned 112 points in 1971-1972.
# text = The numbers indicate that in his first four years, Bush not only showed up, he showed up a lot.
# text = Did you know that?
# text = That brings the story to May 1972 — the time that has been the focus of so many news reports — when Bush “deserted” (according to anti-Bush filmmaker Michael Moore) or went “AWOL” (according to Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee).
# text = Bush asked for permission to go to Alabama to work on a Senate campaign.
# text = His superior officers said OK.
# text = Requests like that weren’t unusual, says retired Col. William Campenni, who flew with Bush in 1970 and 1971.
# text = “In 1972, there was an enormous glut of pilots,” Campenni says.
# text = “The Vietnam War was winding down, and the Air Force was putting pilots in desk jobs.
# text = In ’72 or ’73, if you were a pilot, active or Guard, and you had an obligation and wanted to get out, no problem.
# text = In fact, you were helping them solve their problem.”
# text = So Bush stopped flying.
# text = From May 1972 to May 1973, he earned just 56 points — not much, but enough to meet his requirement.
# text = Then, in 1973, as Bush made plans to leave the Guard and go to Harvard Business School, he again started showing up frequently.
# text = In June and July of 1973, he accumulated 56 points, enough to meet the minimum requirement for the 1973-1974 year.
# text = Then, at his request, he was given permission to go.
# text = Bush received an honorable discharge after serving five years, four months and five days of his original six-year commitment.
# text = By that time, however, he had accumulated enough points in each year to cover six years of service.
# text = During his service, Bush received high marks as a pilot.
# text = A 1970 evaluation said Bush “clearly stands out as a top notch fighter interceptor pilot” and was “a natural leader whom his contemporaries look to for leadership.”
# text = A 1971 evaluation called Bush “an exceptionally fine young officer and pilot” who “continually flies intercept missions with the unit to increase his proficiency even further.”
# text = And a 1972 evaluation called Bush “an exceptional fighter interceptor pilot and officer.”
# text = Now, it is only natural that news reports questioning Bush’s service — in The Boston Globe and The New York Times, on CBS and in other outlets — would come out now.
# text = Democrats are spitting mad over attacks on John Kerry’s record by the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.
# text = And, as it is with Kerry, it’s reasonable to look at a candidate’s entire record, including his military service — or lack of it.
# text = Voters are perfectly able to decide whether it’s important or not in November.
# text = The Kerry camp blames Bush for the Swift boat veterans’ attack, but anyone who has spent much time talking to the Swifties gets the sense that they are doing it entirely for their own reasons.
# text = And it should be noted in passing that Kerry has personally questioned Bush’s service, while Bush has not personally questioned Kerry’s.
# text = In April — before the Swift boat veterans had said a word — Kerry said Bush “has yet to explain to America whether or not, and tell the truth, about whether he showed up for duty.”
# text = Earlier, Kerry said, “Just because you get an honorable discharge does not, in fact, answer that question.”
# text = Now, after the Swift boat episode, the spotlight has returned to Bush.
# text = That’s fine.
# text = We should know as much as we can.
# text = And perhaps someday Kerry will release more of his military records as well.
# text = Byron York is a White House correspondent for National Review.
# text = His column appears in The Hill each week.
# text = One week to elections day and the general atmosphere in the capital is eerie, yet strikingly familiar.
# text = I suspect the streets of Baghdad will look as if a war is looming this week.
# text = There is no doubt that many Iraqis regard the date of 30 January as a day of renewed hope, one they have been awaiting all their lives, but at the same time, many others are already dreading it.
# text = The interim government has promised security measures that would reduce the violence on the day of elections, but I fail to see how they will be able to protect all 5,000 (or so) balloting centres.
# text = Many voting centres have already been successfully attacked or destroyed in many areas.
# text = Now that the picture is clear, the two main competing lists seem to be the United Iraqi Coalition list and Allawi's Al-Iraqiya list.
# text = Ayad Allawi, and other ministers running on his list, have quite expectedly used their governmental positions in campaigning.
# text = One minister reportedly handed out 100 dollar 'gifts' to journalists attending a press conference for Allawi, a practice that brings back bad memories to many Iraqis.
# text = Sheikh Naji Al-Abbudi, a spokesman for Sistani, affirmed the claims that the Grand Ayatollah is backing the United Iraqi Coalition list.
# text = Indeed, Sistani's agents all over the country have been quite active in educating Iraqi Shia on the merits of elections, which has led to the assassination of at least two of them.
# text = Al-Abbudi stated that "His Emminence" decided to openly support the list because "others" (obviously a reference to Allawi) have been abusing official state positions and media outlets in their campaigning.
# text = Again there is no official written statement from Sistani's office confirming this allegation, which I think is intentional.
# text = Ahmed Al-Chalabi and defense minister Hazim Al-Sha'lan have been engaging in shrill public attacks over the media.
# text = Chalabi describing Sha'lan as a "Ba'athist" and a "former double agent for Saddam and the CIA", while Sha'lan dismisses Chalabi as a "thief" and an "Iranian stooge who longs for his own origins by defending Iran".
# text = One remark made by Sha'lan on Al-Arabiya TV, that he couldn't say more about Chalabi because he would embarrass himself and the viewers almost made me roll on the floor.
# text = It was an extremely amusing episode, watching Chalabi looking smug and amused, contrasted with Sha'lan, all serious and barely keeping himself from swearing.
# text = Fistfights, please.
# text = Hazim Al-Sha'lan, by the way, is the son of the late Sheikh of Al-Khaza'il in Diwaniya and has the potential to replace former information minister, M.S. Al-Sahaf, in his nonsensical media statements, which can be passed as jokes.
# text = The main Kurdish coalition list (PUK and KDP) is barely mentioned outside the Kurdish region.
# text = Even there, many Kurds look and act as if they are going to grab the chance to vote them out of power.
# text = I doubt that will be the outcome though.
# text = Many Iraqis, including conservative and religious Iraqis, are surprisingly rooting for the Iraqi Communist party, probably in an attempt to counter the influence of Islamists in the forthcoming National Assembly.
# text = The Communist party has the largest number of registered party members in the country and can be considered as the oldest popular political party in Iraq.
# text = Its support base is much larger than what it seems.
# text = ***
# text = Several candidates were assassinated and targeted these last two weeks, others have been forced under threats to withdraw and to follow the example of the Islamic party.
# text = Sectarian tensions are at their highest since April, 2004, with Sunni insurgents now openly attacking Husseiniyas and Shia mosques.
# text = I had an interesting conversation with a middle-aged taxi driver who used to live in Fallujah and is now at relatives in Amiriya, Baghdad.
# text = After asking me which tribe I belong to (thus assessing my sectarian background) he started hurling abuses at the Shia, calling them Persians, Majoos (fire worshippers), rabid dogs and a handful of other descriptions that I can't mention here.
# text = He described Allawi's face as that of a f*ed horse and he dismissed the whole government as a band of thieves and traitors.
# text = I didn't argue with him but I asked him what he believed would be a viable solution to this mess.
# text = He said that resistance was the only commonsense solution.
# text = First driving out the Americans, then fighting the Shia back into submission (as in 1991).
# text = Sunni Iraqis contend that elections are impossible to hold under occupation.
# text = Leaving aside the fact that this views conflicts with other historical examples in the region, Sunnis have never offered an alternative choice, which eventually leads one to guess that the opinion held by the Fallujan taxi driver above is precisely what they are planning to implement.
# text = I had another conversation some months ago with a retired Ba'athist old-timer who claimed that Ba'athists have the means to stage a third coup d'etat and return to power within 10 hours of an American withdrawal.
# text = On sensing my incredulity to his statement he asserted that Ba'athist cells exist in all parts of the country and that they do have a central command, even though many have formed seperate cells (often under Islamic labels) with their own leaderships.
# text = He said that they have the training and the funding as well as the support of neighbouring and regional governments.
# text = I concur that Ba'athists and former security forces are capable of immediately controlling at least 5 out of 18 governorates, along with the capital, if Americans are to be removed from the picture entirely.
# text = But I also see that as a fatal misconception, which is doing Sunnis harm, because I don't believe the US is going anywhere so soon.
# text = Any government that assumes power after the elections also realises this, so not even Sistani is going to call the US to withdraw its troops, despite what he is saying now, not until they are ensured the insurgency is out of the picture, or that they have an alternative foreign power (in this case Iran) to back them up.
# text = The only hope now is that, following the elections, the National Assembly would offer the hand of peace and reconciliation to the dissenting parties.
# text = I would suggest going for tribal Sheikhs rather than clerics, since they have the upper hand in their areas and can effectively root out any Ba'athists in their midst in return for a promise of sharing power and authority.
# text = Many of these Sheikhs have been disenfranchised and abused over the last two years.
# text = Very recently, US forces in Al-Anbar made a terrible blunder by accidentally killing Abdul-Razaq Inad Al-Gu'ud, Sheikh of the Al-Bu Nimr clan from the powerful Dulaym tribe.
# text = Al-Gu'ud had favoured elections and was in good terms with the government.
# text = The Gu'ud family even accepted to be offered the seat of Al-Anbar governor some months back.
# text = The Al-Bu Nimr in Ramadi and Al-Qaim rose in arms against Saddam in the mid-nineties following the execution of Thamir Madhlum Al-Dulaymi, an Air Force general belonging to their tribe.
# text = The revolt took two weeks to be suppressed by the Republican Guard.
# text = Another bad step was the recent arrest of Sheikh Hassan Al-Lihabi, of the Lihaib tribe which is scattered between the governorates of Al-Anbar, Mosul and Salah Al-Din.
# text = Al-Lihaibi was running in elections and is now said to have withdrawn following this incident.
# text = I believe national reconciliation to be the only path forward to a new Iraq.
# text = The Shia cannot live without the Sunnis, and vice versa.
# text = Both have shared this country for the last 14 centuries and there is no possible way that one can live without the other.
# text = Even partition is not a possibility, there are no clear borders between the two.
# text = Remember Luis Posada Carriles ?
# text = Here's a Miami Herald interview with the relaxed terrorist and former CIA operative in a luxury condo, published yesterday.
# text = ("At first I hid a lot.
# text = I thought the US government was looking for me.
# text = Now I hide a lot less.")
# text = Because of such talk, Posada has been taken into custody by Immigration officials.
# text = I can't imagine they wanted to do this.
# text = Authorities would likely have been happy answering questions about Posada's whereabouts with an indefinite shrug.
# text = As recently as last week the official line stated they had no knowledge he had entered the country.
# text = But comfortable among the thugs, Posada overplayed his hand and embarrassed his old patron, the US government.
# text = And though he'd been a faithful servant, he was not such a player that he could get away with that.
# text = He should have taken a cue from another bomber some pesky dark-skinned foreigners want extradited, CIA operative Michael Meiring.
# text = Posada should have told any inquisitive journalist at his doorstep something like Meiring told the single American reporter who bothered following his bloody trail from the Philippines, that "If this harms me in any way, you will find my power then, and you'll find out who I am."
# text = But then, maybe that wouldn't have saved him either, because Posada is not Meiring.
# text = Posada can be given up, but Meiring can't.
# text = Meiring's crimes are fresh, and wave the false flag which is the "War on Terror."
# text = They happened in the Philippines which, like Pakistan, is an important and vulnerable node for the business which intelligence agencies and terrorist organizations conduct with each other.
# text = (Ask Terry Nichols about the Philippines.)
# text = The bombings implicated Muslims, and exacerbated regional tensions which the Bush regime and its friends wearing the brass in the Philippine military sought to exploit.
# text = Posada's crimes, on the other hand, must seem like ancient history, especially to a people who don't know their history.
# text = And to those who don't even know their crimes, not even that.
# text = But will Posada be given up?
# text = I doubt he will be extradited to Venezuela, which is the only way that question could be answered with a Yes.
# text = I expect it will be determined that, under "Strong Man" Hugo Chavez, Posada could not be guaranteed a fair trial.
# text = The hope may be that Posada can soon be offered to a post-Chavez Allawi-like puppet in Caracas.
# text = Whether such an offer were accepted or declined would make no difference; justice would not be served then.
# text = But Posada's nearly 80 years old, and the Venezuelan people will ensure that's a vain hope.
# text = So instead Posada may be held indefinitely, in comfortable custody.
# text = An embarrassment to the US still, just not as embarrassing as having the old killer strut about Miami, gloating in his freedom.
# text = Meiring is more than an embarrassment.
# text = His case threatens the consensus fiction of the "War on Terror."
# text = So his name will remain unspoken.
# text = Another connection to Philippine terror and weapons smuggling- dating from the 1980s- is alleged in the book Disposable Patriot, by Jack Terrell.
# text = Terrell, a CIA asset originally recruited for the Contra effort, identifies the man attempting to recruit him into the Philippine scheme as Oliver North...
# text = I seem to recall the object was to smuggle explosives.
# text = http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0915765381/701-3377456-8181939
# text = I've read the book- it's a first person memoir with the ring of truth, especially since so much of the wider context has confirmed the allegations of Contra drug connections that led to Terrell becoming a target for discrediting by the TWIG counterintelligence group that ran interference for the Contra effort, staffed by covert ops types including Ollie North, Robert Owen, Vince Cannistaro and Buck Revell.
# text = Peter Dale Scott includes an account of how Terrell's whistleblowing was stifled by them in his book Cocaine Politics.
# text = ... same ole, same ole...
# text = Due to the Judge in the 1983 case ruling that a CIA agent could not testify using a pseudonym, therefore opening him to cross-examination by Wilson, the prosecution had a problem.
# text = They needed someone that could convince the jury they had been able to see all relevant documents in CIA files on Wilson.
# text = Wilson was claiming that he had been working for the CIA when he sold the C-4 to Quaddaffi.
# text = The prosecution was charging he was a rogue using his contacts from former service in both CIA and the 'Office of Naval Intelligence'.
# text = Wilson had been able to show that he'd had more than 80 "non-social contacts" with the CIA since his retirement in 1971, leaving the prosecution's case in turmoil.
# text = Then Charles A. Briggs came to the rescue.
# text = Third ranking CIA officer, Briggs signed a declaration on February 3rd, 1983, that on November 8th, 1982, he had authorized a search of CIA records "for any material that in any way pertains to Edwin P. Wilson, or the various allegations concerning his activities after February 28th, 1971, when he retired from the CIA."
# text = The Briggs Declaration states that with one exception in 1972, Wilson did not work "directly or indirectly" for the CIA since retiring.
# text = http://www.disinfo.com/archive/pages/dossier/id334/pg1/
# text = Last week, Federal District Judge Lynn Hughes in Huston, Texas, threw out Wilson's two-decades old conviction.
# text = Judge Hughes wrote: `government knowingly used false evidence against him,' concluding `honesty comes hard to government.'

# text = Former Pastor, Deputy Implicated In Church Child Sex Abuse
# text = PONCHATOULA, La. --

# text = Trouble on India's islands
# text = Ramtanu Maitra
# text = In early February, India charged 34 Arakan separatists from Myanmar with hiding in the Landfall Islands, part of the Andaman Islands group (see end note).
# text = These alleged members of the Arakan Army, the military wing of the National Unity Party in Myanmar, have been charged with illegal entry.
# text = It is likely, but not certain, that they will be deported to Myanmar.
# text = But the news of the Arakan rebels is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to growing concern in New Delhi over the security of the Andaman Islands.
# text = Reports are circulating in the intelligence community that the Andaman Islands are not only thick with Myanmar rebels.
# text = It has also become an arms depot of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who operate almost freely in the Andaman Sea.
# text = Information pointing in this direction came to light after the December 26 tsunami, which took a heavy toll on the Andamans.
# text = Correspondents who flocked in to cover the tsunami found they also had another story - the miserable security situation surrounding the Indian navy's Far Eastern Naval Command, now being established along with India's "blue water navy".
# text = Deteriorating security
# text = Security problems in the Andaman Sea are not new, but they have deteriorated during the past few years, in tandem with a deterioration in the security situation in Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, and particularly in the northeastern Indian states of Manipur, Nagaland and Tripura.
# text = While the Indian army has become rock-solid in the western front, and has developed the capability of withstanding any Pakistani adventure in that sector, it has become highly vulnerable in its eastern sector, where its enemy is not a national army but a multitude of secessionist, terrorist and drug-running militants operating between Southeast Asia and northeastern India through Bangladesh.
# text = The Andaman Sea is a major conduit for this traffic, and the 572 large and small islands that constitute the Andaman and Nicobar group are a natural transit base.
# text = The drugs and arms travel in all directions.
# text = Since the "Sea Tigers" of the LTTE, better known as the Tamil Tigers, are the ones who rule the Andaman Sea: they carry the arms and drugs for their own use and also to deliver to rebels in Aceh and all along the east coast of Africa.
# text = It is old news that the Tamil Tigers have developed a strong network within South Africa.
# text = This is not unknown to New Delhi.
# text = A recent report by a journalist from Port Blair, in the Andamans, quoted an unnamed official saying that foreigners from Myanmar, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have permanently settled in the islands, using fake Indian ration cards, while citizens of Thailand, China, Indonesia and Malaysia have migrated temporarily to plunder the natural resources and leave.
# text = "Port Blair, Havelock Islands, Diglipur, Middle Nicobar, Campbell's Bay, Neil Islands and Rangott are mostly overrun by foreigners," he said.
# text = An official estimate issued in 2003 suggests there are 50,000 "foreigners" in the Andaman Islands, but unofficial figures are much higher than this.
# text = A large number of them are Bangladeshis, who like millions of their countrymen have left their densely populated homeland to settle elsewhere.
# text = As most of them have few technical skills, and the Andamans have little demand for them in any case, they turn to smuggling and other unlawful activities.
# text = The presence of the Sea Tigers in the area with guns, cash and drugs makes the situation extremely dangerous.
# text = Reports from Port Blair make it evident that New Delhi gets little on-the-ground intelligence, and the Indian Coast Guard is grossly unequipped to deal with the surge of illegal migrants to the islands.
# text = One unnamed naval officer was quoted saying, "Arms smuggling is a very profitable business in this region."
# text = Considering the islands' huge strategic importance, it is amazing how lax New Delhi has been.
# text = These islands sit aside the vital sea lanes of the Strait of Malacca, through which 300 tankers and merchant ships pass daily, bringing in oil for the Far East and Southeast Asia.
# text = Intelligence lapses
# text = As the implications of the Andaman Islands situation sink in, Indian intelligence has inevitably come under scrutiny.
# text = In recent months, its fallibility has become evident.
# text = The inability to foresee in advance the assassination attempt on the pro-India political leader and former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed last August 21 at a political rally in Dhaka, and the recent "coup" by Nepalese King Gyanendra dismissing his government and imposing a virtual absolute monarchy, are glaring examples of intelligence failure.
# text = With growing economic and military power, India will be dependent on smaller nations in the region increasingly to maintain regional security.
# text = Unless New Delhi does better in providing security to its own nationals against rebels, secessionists, drug runners and arms traffickers, it will not generate much confidence in the capitals of surrounding nations.
# text = In fact, it would tend to encourage more organized anti-India outfits, such as the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and outside-linked Maoists, to exploit these networks and weaken India's eastern flank.
# text = Indian intelligence's lackluster performance in dealing with the LTTE is startling.
# text = This formidable enemy, which gave the Indian army a black eye in the mid-1980s, has been operating in northeastern India and in the Andaman Sea for a long time.
# text = In 2001, according to Indian army officials, security forces launched a wide-ranging operation in the 300-some inhabited islands neighboring Andaman and Nicobar, and found huge caches of arms.
# text = The arms were said to belong to the LTTE and "other terrorist groups".
# text = The search-and-destroy operation was carried out by the Indian government after repeated requests from Colombo.
# text = In addition, LTTE activity in the Andaman Sea is well known to local observers.
# text = The biggest LTTE maritime disaster was reported in the now-defunct Asiaweek in 2001.
# text = A shipment of weapons, ammunition and explosives, believed to have been purchased from Cambodia and worth several million dollars, left the port of Phuket in Thailand in early February 2001 aboard the freighter Comex-Joux 3.
# text = As is LTTE standard procedure, the vessel changed its name at sea to Horizon.
# text = On its journey across the Bay of Bengal the freighter was tracked by the Indian navy and Orissa-based spy planes of India's Aviation Research Center; it was intercepted by Indian naval vessels off Sri Lanka's east coast.
# text = LTTE arms-running
# text = In 1997, the Thai navy reported the interception of a 16-meter boat after a chase off the Thai port of Ranong, and the confiscation of two tons of weapons and ammunition.
# text = Among the weapons intercepted were two rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, 20 assault rifles, M-79 grenade launchers and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition.
# text = Four persons were arrested, reportedly belonging to the Manipur Revolutionary People's Front.
# text = Six crew members were from the Arakan region of Myanmar.
# text = The boat was heading toward Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh.
# text = Until 1995 the LTTE maintained a base at Twante, an island off the coat of Myanmar, west of the Andaman islands.
# text = Subsequently, Phuket became the LTTE's main backup base.
# text = A Sri Lanka-born Tamil with a Norwegian passport was arrested by Thai authorities in 2000 for his links with the LTTE.
# text = At the time of his arrest, the suspect was allegedly involved in constructing a "submarine" in a shipyard on the island of Sirae near Phuket on the Andaman Sea coast.
# text = Steady buildup
# text = The real threat to the Andaman Islands is the steady building-up of ports and conduits that serve the Tamil Tigers and a host of less-strong militant groups.
# text = Over the past decade, Bangladesh has steadily moved into a state of lawlessness.
# text = A number of extremist groups, under the cover of the Islamist movement, have become active in drug trafficking, gun running and anti-Indian activities.
# text = It is widely acknowledged that the Pakistani ISI has nurtured a number of extremist Islamist groups, such as the Harkat-ul-Jehad-al-Islami, in the port city of Chittagong, and put a number of secessionist rebels from India's northeast in touch with this terrorist network.
# text = As a result, north of the Andaman Islands, Bangladeshi coastal areas have become a nest of terrorists involved in the shipment of drugs and arms.
# text = A pattern of arrests and seizures indicate that arms are brought by the LTTE from Laos, Cambodia and Thailand into Chittagong, from where they are transported northward by land to Bhutan.
# text = The route from Kalikhola in Bhutan to Cox's Bazar passes through northern Bengal, Assam and Meghalaya, and on into Chittagong.
# text = Note
# text = India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands comprise more than 500 islands lying 1,000 kilometers east of Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal.
# text = Stretching 750 kilometers from end to end, they reach from near the coast of Myanmar almost to Sumatra in Indonesia.
# text = The Ten Degree Channel divides the Andamans, which are the larger and more heavily populated northern islands, from the 20 or so Nicobar Islands in the south.
# text = On South Andaman, the most heavily populated island, is Port Blair, which is the capital and the only large town in the entire archipelago.
# text = Travel to the Nicobar Islands is forbidden to non-Indians, and they are also not allowed in some parts of South Andaman Island.

# text = [ Karzai also has to deal with the stepped up rivalry between India and Pakistan in Afghanistan.
# text = Islamabad accuses New Delhi of using its consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad to train Balochi insurgents who are active in Pakistani Balochistan.
# text = Pakistani officials claim there are as many as 42 RAW agents based in Kandahar and another 12 in Jalalabad.
# text = “There have no business being there unless they are undermining Pakistan,’’ says a Pakistani official.
# text = Both India and Afghanistan deny the claim.
# text = ‘’Should Pakistan show us any evidence of an Indian hand using Afghan soil to work against our neighbours we will take it very seriously,” says Amrullah Saleh the head of Afghanistan’s National Security Directorate. ]
# text = Karzai, Musharraf new regional equations
# text = KABUL:
# text = For the past 25 years landlocked Afghanistan has suffered from constant interference from its neighbours - Pakistan, Iran and the Central Asian Republics - and regional powers -Russia and India.
# text = The neighbours are still interfering, but there are signs that rather than undermining Afghanistan’s stability they may now be trying to strengthen it.
# text = “The elections should be a reassurance to all our neighbours that a stable Afghanistan, a peaceful Afghanistan is good for all.
# text = Nobody should feel a looser in Afghanistan,’’ President Hamid Karzai told Pakistan’s English daily The Nation.
# text = All the regional countries have publicly backed the Karzai government and supported the electoral process, but serious undercurrents remain as they all have their favourite contenders in Afghanistan.
# text = Since September 11, Pakistan has been repeatedly accused by Afghan and Western leaders of harbouring Taliban extremists who had pledged to disrupt the elections, but at the highest level the US has avoided criticising President Pervaiz Musharraf on the grounds that he is helping the US catch Al Qaeda elements inside Pakistan.
# text = That changed on September 22 when President George W. Bush, Musharraf and Karzai held a three way meeting in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
# text = The meeting was pushed together by the CIA and the US Defence Department who were desperately anxious to secure a peaceful election in Afghanistan and the non-interference of alleged Pakistani backed Taliban.
# text = Western and Afghan diplomats intimately involved with the meeting, said Bush pushed Musharraf hard on reigning in the Taliban so the elections could take place peacefully.
# text = ‘’Where are Mullah Omar, Mullah Usmani and Gulbuddin Hikmetar?’’
# text = Bush is reported to have asked a flustered Musharraf.
# text = All three are extremist Taliban or their allies and known to be living in Pakistan.
# text = (Mullah Omar is leader of the Taliban, Usmani is the former corps commander of Kandahar under the Taliban regime and now a commander of Taliban forces while Hikmetyar heads the extremist Hizb-e-Islami.)
# text = ‘’It was the first time that Bush totally focused on the Taliban threat rather than Al Qaeda with the Pakistanis,’’ says a Western diplomat.
# text = ‘’Bush was very well briefed before the meeting,’’ the diplomat said.
# text = An Afghan official at the meeting added, ‘’The Americans now realise that the Taliban are a bigger threat to our security than Al Qaeda.’’
# text = Karzai was clearly pleased at the results.
# text = ‘’President Musharraf promised to help us and cooperate with us on curbing terrorist activity by the Taliban,’’ says Karzai.
# text = The next day an angry Musharraf categorically said that Pakistan would not send Pakistani troops to Iraq, a clear snub to the Americans.
# text = Until then he had said Pakistan’s options were open.
# text = However Pakistani officials insist that the decision was unconnected to the tripartite meeting.
# text = US and NATO military officers in Kabul say it is too early to say whether Bush’s tough message was instrumental in persuading Musharraf and the ISI to pressure the Taliban to restrain from disrupting the elections.
# text = However there were visible signs of a crackdown on the Pakistan side.
# text = ‘’Pakistan now has a large force deployed in Baluchistan which was not there before,’’ says Lt. General David Barno.
# text = ‘’There is much better tactical cooperation between our forces on both sides of the border, but the movement of Taliban still goes on both ways,’’ he adds.
# text = Also several days before the elections Pakistan closed the border crossing point at Chaman in Baluchistan which is a key entry point for the Taliban into Afghanistan.
# text = However US military officers say regular army officers - many of them Pashtun - leading units of the Frontier Corps who are on the border remain deeply sympathetic to the Taliban and the mullahs of the JUI.
# text = At the same time the US remains oblivious of the serious problems and political fallout which the army is facing in its operations in Waziristan.
# text = Not only is the army facing serious political fallout, growing anti-Americanism and anti-army feeling in the tribal areas but it is also taking heavy casualties -between 400-500 Pakistani soldiers have been killed in the region since March.
# text = Musharraf has always maintained that the US has never provided actionable intelligence about Taliban leaders hiding in Baluchistan.
# text = That too may change.
# text = US and Afghan intelligence will shortly be presenting the ISI with a list of Taliban extremists and their suspected whereabouts.
# text = Moreover there are now major covert attempts under way to try and bring back to Kabul leading Taliban commanders, who have been living quietly in Pakistan and have taken no part in the Taliban insurgency.
# text = With the Taliban failure to disrupt the Afghan elections, the militants are even more isolated from the mainstream Taliban who want to return home.
# text = Until now Pakistan has not facilitated such a return and clearly it cannot happen until there is both a pull from Kabul and a push from Islamabad.
# text = With President Karzai certain to win the elections and the demotion of key former Northern Alliance figures such as General Fahim and warlord Ismail Khan, there is now little reason for moderate Taliban leaders to fear reprisals from former Northern Alliance figures if they return home.
# text = Their removal should also provide increased motivation for Pakistan to help the return of moderate Taliban.
# text = Afghan officials welcomed the appointment on October 3 of Lt. General Ashfaq Kiyani as the new ISI chief.
# text = Kayani is well known and liked in Kabul as during the last year he led the Pakistani delegation in the tripartite military meetings with the Afghan and US military on issues related to border issues.
# text = Karzai also has to deal with the stepped up rivalry between India and Pakistan in Afghanistan.
# text = Islamabad accuses New Delhi of using its consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad to train Balochi insurgents who are active in Pakistani Balochistan.
# text = Pakistani officials claim there are as many as 42 RAW agents based in Kandahar and another 12 in Jalalabad.
# text = “There have no business being there unless they are undermining Pakistan,’’ says a Pakistani official.
# text = Both India and Afghanistan deny the claim.
# text = ‘’Should Pakistan show us any evidence of an Indian hand using Afghan soil to work against our neighbours we will take it very seriously,” says Amrullah Saleh the head of Afghanistan’s National Security Directorate.
# text = Karzai categorically said that he has assured Musharraf repeatedly that any adverse action against Pakistan taken by Indian diplomats inside Afghanistan would be acted upon swiftly.
# text = Senior US diplomats and military officials have warned India also.
# text = In a major regional shift reflecting the newly strengthened position of Karzai, Iran, Russia and India which have traditionally backed the Tajik dominated former Northern Alliance made strenuous efforts to convince presidential candidate Younis Qanooni to strike a deal with Karzai before the elections and not to oppose Karzai.
# text = Iran in particular feared that Qanooni would loose and then be politically isolated from the mainstream.
# text = Qanooni refused to accept the Iranian advice as his fellow Panjsheri Tajiks urged him to stand against Karzai.
# text = However since the elections Iranian influence has proved critical in convincing the Hazara Shia candidate Mohammed Mohaqeq to accept the results of the elections and later convincing Qanooni to do the same.
# text = With the US military presence posing a threat on their borders in both Iraq and Afghanistan, Iran’s moderate leadership is keen to help stabilise Karzai so that the US presence in Afghanistan is reduced.
# text = However powerful hardliners in Tehran may be trying to undermine that strategy and a new issue is likely to deepen the rift with the moderates.
# text = Iranian officials are deeply concerned about the US occupation of Shindand, a massive Soviet-era airbase just 30 kilometres from Iran’s border.
# text = The enhanced US presence in western Afghanistan was only made possible after the ousting of Ismail Khan, the warlord and Governor of Herat province last month, who was a close ally of Iranian hardliners.
# text = Iranian officials say they made no objections to Khan’s ouster because they want to strengthen Karzai’s campaign against warlords.
# text = At a time of heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington over Iran’s nuclear weapons program and calls by neo-conservatives in Washington that a second Bush term should deal with Iran aggressively, the Iranians fear that Shindand could be used as a listening post, spying facility and even a launching pad for any future US actions against Iran.
# text = Afghan officials say the Americans have moved over 100 Special Forces and helicopters to Shindand.
# text = However General Barno insists the US presence poses no threat to Iran.
# text = ‘’We have a very small number of forces in Shindand with a few helicopters,’’ says Barno.
# text = Nevertheless this places Karzai in a difficult and sensitive situation because he has to maintain excellent relations with both the US and Iran.
# text = ‘’Afghanistan has had the benefit of cooperation from both the US and Iran.
# text = So far what they have done together has been good for us and that’s how we would like to keep it’’, says Karzai.
# text = Nobody can claim that the interference of Afghanistan’s neighbours is over, but the elections will do much to strengthen Karzai and deal more firmly with neighbours’ interference.
# text = In the post election scenario it is becoming abundantly clear that the Taliban do not have the support of the Afghan people nor the Afghan Pashtuns.
# text = In a highly significant move Afghan Pashtun tribes along the Pakistan border warned the Taliban in Quetta and Chaman that if they try and disrupt the elections, they would be resisted.
# text = Many Taliban living in Afghanistan voted for President Karzai.
# text = It is now abundantly clear that with the rapidly changing face of Afghanistan, the demise of key Northern Alliance figures and the fluid political situation in Afghanistan, Pakistan should reconsider its policy of giving unlimited sanctuary to Taliban extremists living on Pakistani soil.
# text = Pakistan Link 16/10/2004
# text = The debate that a handful of Texas multi-millionnaires close to the Bush family have cleverly manufactured over John Kerry's war record is absurd in every way.
# text = The charges that they have put some vets up to making against Kerry are false and can be demonstrated by the historical record to be false .
# text = Most of those making the charges have even flip-flopped, contradicting themselves.
# text = Or they weren't eyewitnesses and are just lying.
# text = But to address the substance of this Big Lie is to risk falling into its logic.
# text = The true absurdity of the entire situation is easily appreciated when we consider that George W. Bush never showed any bravery at all at any point in his life.
# text = He has never lived in a war zone.
# text = If some of John Kerry's wounds were superficial, Bush received no wounds.
# text = (And, a piece of shrapnel in the forearm that caused only a minor wound would have killed had it hit an eye and gone into the brain; the shrapnel being in your body demonstrates you were in mortal danger and didn't absent yourself from it.
# text = That is the logic of the medal).
# text = Kerry saved a man's life while under fire.
# text = Bush did no such thing.
# text = What was Bush doing with his youth?
# text = He was drinking.
# text = He was drinking like a fish, every night, into the wee hours.
# text = For decades.
# text = He gave no service to anyone, risked nothing, and did not even slack off efficiently.
# text = The history of alcoholism and possibly other drug use is a key issue because it not only speaks to Bush's character as an addictive personality, but may tell us something about his erratic and alarming actions as president.
# text = His explosive temper probably provoked the disastrous siege of Fallujah last spring, killing 600 Iraqis, most of them women and children, in revenge for the deaths of 4 civilian mercenaries, one of them a South African.
# text = (Newsweek reported that Bush commanded his cabinet, "Let heads roll!")
# text = That temper is only one problem.
# text = Bush has a sadistic streak.
# text = He clearly enjoyed, as governor, watching executions.
# text = His delight in killing people became a campaign issue in 2000 when he seemed, in one debate, to enjoy the prospect of executing wrong-doers a little too much.
# text = He has clearly gone on enjoying killing people on a large scale in Iraq.
# text = Drug abuse can affect the ability of the person to feel deep emotions like empathy.
# text = Two decades of pickling his nervous system in various highly toxic substances have left Bush damaged goods.
# text = Even for those who later abstain, "visual-spatial abilities, abstraction, problem solving , and short-term memory, are the slowest to recover."
# text = That he managed to get on the wagon (though with that pretzel incident, you wonder how firmly) is laudable.
# text = But he suffers the severe effects of the aftermath, and we are all suffering along with him now, since he is the most powerful man in the world.
# text = We all know by now that Bush did not even do his full service with the Texas Air National Guard, absenting himself to work on the Alabama senate campaign of Winton "Red" Blount.
# text = Whether he was actually AWOL during this stint is unclear.
# text = But it is clear that not only did Bush slack off on his National Guard service, but he slacked off from his campaign work.
# text = This little-noted interview with Blount's nephew Murph Archibald, which appeared on National Public Radio's "All Things Considered on March 30, 2004, gives a devastating insight into what it was like to have to suffer through Bush in that period.
# text = "All Things Considered (8:00 PM ET) - NPR March 30, 2004 Tuesday
# text = This campaign season, there have been questions about whether George W. Bush fulfilled his obligations to the National Guard as a young lieutenant in the early 1970s.
# text = For weeks, reporters scoured Alabama in search of pilots or anyone who might have remembered seeing Mr. Bush at the time he was serving in the National Guard there.
# text = There is one place in Alabama where Mr. Bush was present nearly every day: the headquarters in Montgomery of US Senate candidate Winton "Red" Blount.
# text = President Bush has always said that working for Blount was the reason he transferred to the Alabama Air National Guard.
# text = NPR's Wade Goodwyn has this report about Mr. Bush's time on that campaign.
# text = WADE GOODWYN reporting:
# text = In 1972, Baba Groom was a smart, funny young woman smack-dab in the middle of an exciting US Senate campaign.
# text = Groom was Republican Red Blount's scheduler, and in that job, she was the hub in the campaign wheel.
# text = Ask her about the handsome young man from Texas, and she remembers him 32 years later like it was yesterday.
# text = Ms. BABA GROOM (Former Campaign Worker):
# text = He would wear khaki trousers and some old jacket.
# text = He was always ready to go out on the road.
# text = On the phone, you could hear his accent.
# text = It was a Texas accent.
# text = But he just melded with everybody.
# text = GOODWYN: The candidate Mr. Bush was working for, Red Blount, had gotten rich in Alabama in the construction business.
# text = Prominent Southern Republicans were something of a rare breed in those days.
# text = Blount's support of the party led him to be appointed Richard Nixon's postmaster general.
# text = In Washington, Blount became friends and tennis partners with Mr. Bush's father, then Congressman Bush.
# text = That was how 26-year-old Lieutenant Bush came to Montgomery, at his father's urging . . .
# text = It was Mr. Bush's job to organize the Republican county chairpersons in the 67 Alabama counties.
# text = Back in 1972 in the Deep South, many rural counties didn't have much in the way of official Republican Party apparatus.
# text = But throughout Alabama, there were Republicans and Democrats who wanted to help Red Blount.
# text = It was the young Texan's job to find out what each county leader needed in the way of campaign supplies and get those supplies to them.
# text = Groom says this job helped Mr. Bush understand how even in a statewide Senate campaign, politics are local.
# text = . . . Murph Archibald is Red Blount's nephew by marriage, and in 1972, he was coming off a 15-month tour in Vietnam in the infantry.
# text = Archibald says that in a campaign full of dedicated workers, Mr. Bush was not one of them.
# text = Mr. MURPH ARCHIBALD (Nephew of Red Blount): Well, I was coming in early in the morning and leaving in mid-evenings.
# text = Ordinarily, George would come in around noon; he would ordinarily leave around 5:30 or 6:00 in the evening.
# text = GOODWYN: Archibald says that two months before the election, in September of '72, Red Blount's campaign manager came to him and asked that he quietly take over Mr. Bush's job because the campaign materials were not getting out to the counties.
# text = Mr. ARCHIBALD: George certainly didn't seem to have any concerns about my taking over this work with the campaign workers there.
# text = My overall impression was that he didn't seem as interested in the campaign as the other people who were working at the state headquarters.
# text = GOODWYN: Murph Archibald says that at first, he didn't know that Mr. Bush was serving in the Air National Guard.
# text = After he found out from somebody else, Archibald attempted to talk to Mr. Bush about it.
# text = The president was a lieutenant and Archibald had been a lieutenant, too; he figured they had something to talk about.
# text = Mr. ARCHIBALD: George didn't have any interest at all in talking about the military.
# text = In fact, when I broached the subject with him, he simply changed the subject.
# text = He wasn't unpleasant about it, but he just changed the subject and wouldn't talk about it.
# text = GOODWYN: Far from Texas and Washington, DC, Mr. Bush enjoyed his freedom.
# text = He dated a beautiful young woman working on the campaign.
# text = He went out in the evenings and had a good time.
# text = In fact, he left the house he rented in such disrepair--with damage to the walls and a chandelier destroyed--that the Montgomery family who owned it still grumble about the unpaid repair bill.
# text = Archibald says Mr. Bush would come into the office and, in a friendly way, offer up stories about the drinking he'd done the night before, kind of as a conversation starter.
# text = Mr. ARCHIBALD: People have different ways of starting the days in any office.
# text = They're going to talk about their kids, they're going to talk about football, they're going to talk about the weather.
# text = And this was simply his opening gambit; he would start talking about that he had been out late the night before drinking.
# text = GOODWYN: Archibald says the frequency with which Mr. Bush discussed the subject was off-putting to him.
# text = Mr. ARCHIBALD: I mean, at that time, I was 28; George would have been 25 or 26.
# text = And I thought it was really unusual that someone in their mid-20s would initiate conversations, particularly in the context of something as serious as a US senatorial campaign, by talking about their drinking the night before.
# text = I thought it unusual and, frankly, inappropriate.
# text = GOODWYN: According to Archibald, Mr. Bush would also sometimes tell stories about his days at Yale in New Haven, and how whenever he got pulled over for erratic driving, he was let go after the officers discovered he was the grandson of a Connecticut US senator.
# text = Archibald, a middle-class Alabama boy--who, by the way, is now a registered Democrat--didn't like that story.
# text = Mr. ARCHIBALD: He told us whenever he was stopped, as soon as the law enforcement found out that he was the grandson of Prescott Bush, they would let him go.
# text = And he would always laugh about that. "
# text = Goodwyn dutifully notes that Baba Groom didn't remember George telling drunk stories.
# text = But that means nothing, since they weren't the sort of things guys like Bush told the "girls".
# text = He was trying to buddy with Archibald and impress him.
# text = Again, decades of this sort of behavior do not leave a person untouched.
# text = Our world is in crisis and our Republic is in danger.
# text = It should not be left in the hands of a man who spent his life like this.
# text = When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men
# text = Just remember that death is not the end
# text = And you search in vain to find just one law abiding citizen
# text = Just remember that death is not the end - Bob Dylan
# text = Afraid I don't have time today to discuss these, but some stories need attention:
# text = From Wednesday's Mirror the headline, "Have 200,000 AK47s Fallen Into the Hands of Iraq Terrorists?"
# text = (also see this thread on the RI discussion board):
# text = Some 200,000 guns the US sent to Iraqi security forces may have been smuggled to terrorists, it was feared yesterday.
# text = The 99-tonne cache of AK47s was to have been secretly flown out from a US base in Bosnia.
# text = But the four planeloads of arms have vanished.
# text = Orders for the deal to go ahead were given by the US Department of Defense.
# text = But the work was contracted out via a complex web of private arms traders .
# text = And the Moldovan airline used to transport the shipment was blasted by the UN in 2003 for smuggling arms to Liberia, human rights group Amnesty has discovered.
# text = It follows a separate probe claiming that thousands of guns meant for Iraq's police and army instead went to al-Qaeda .
# text = Amnesty chief spokesman Mike Blakemore said: "It's unbelievable that no one can account for 200,000 assault rifles.
# text = If these weapons have gone missing it's a terrifying prospect."
# text = American defence chiefs hired a US firm to take the guns, from the 90s Bosnian war, to Iraq.
# text = But air traffic controllers in Baghdad have no record of the flights, which supposedly took off between July 2004 and July 2005.
# text = A coalition forces spokesman confirmed they had not received "any weapons from Bosnia" and added they were "not aware of any purchases for Iraq from Bosnia".
# text = Nato and US officials have already voiced fears that Bosnian arms - sold by US, British and Swiss firms - are being passed to insurgents.
# text = A NATO spokesman said: "There's no tracking mechanism to ensure they don't fall into the wrong hands.
# text = There are concerns that some may have been siphoned off."
# text = This year a newspaper claimed two UK firms were involved in a deal in which thousands of guns for Iraqi forces were re-routed to al-Qaeda.
# text = The Moldovan airline is Aerocom, and yes , it's one of Victor Bout's .
# text = It's always a bang-your-head-against-the-wall moment, reading again the play the incompetence theory receives, even from some of the Administration's harshest mainstream critics.
# text = But then, even to talk of an "administration" may be misdirection at this point, given how little representative government means in the United States these days, and how much of "national security" has been privatized into a global gangland of drugs and guns.
# text = Like the tens of billions of dollars that have been "lost" in Iraq, planeloads of arms don't just "vanish"; not when the Pentagon contracts the work to an international criminal of Bout's untouchable stature.
# text = But Bout's name isn't likely to be mentioned in whatever coverage this story receives, before it sinks like so many others beneath the media's frothing triviality.
# text = Meanwhile, a decision's been reached in the trial of Toledo priest Gerald Robinson.
# text = And it's guilty :
# text = The Rev. Gerald Robinson appeared stony-faced as the jury's guilty verdict was read, and he blinked repeatedly and glanced at his lawyers before being led away in handcuffs.
# text = ...
# text = The crime occurred in the sacristy adjoining the hospital chapel in downtown Toledo on the Saturday before Easter in 1980.
# text = Investigators said the nun, Margaret Ann Pahl, 71, was strangled and then stabbed, with nine wounds on her chest forming the shape of an inverted cross, a well-recognized Satanic symbol.
# text = An altar cloth was draped over her half-naked body, which was posed as if she had been sexually assaulted.
# text = "It was about how he could humiliate her the most," prosecutor Dean Mandros said in closing arguments.
# text = "He left a message for everyone to see ... maybe to God himself."
# text = After the sentencing one of Robinson's tearful supporters "turned to Claudia Vercellotti, a local leader of the Survivors Network for Those Abused by Priests [SNAP], who had helped reopen the case, and told her, 'I hope you rot in hell!'"
# text = From SNAP's statement on the Robinson conviction:
# text = More than ever, police and prosecutors have the tools and the will to go after horrific crimes, even when the defendants are seemingly powerful individuals or institutions .
# text = When victims and witnesses stay silent, nothing changes.
# text = When victims and witnesses speak up, at least sometimes a child is protected, the truth is exposed, and justice is done.
# text = The murder weapon, Robinson's letter opener:
# text = Finally, from an email, a follow-up on the reopening of the investigation into the Atlanta Child Murders :
# text = Dekalb County Police Chief Louis Graham...the man who reopened the investigations last year, is mysteriously stepping down.
# text = And of all the people who the county is getting to find a replacement...is none other than Lee Brown, the original supervisor of the Atlanta PD, who was in office during the murders and the subsequent investigation.
# text = SNAP is right in part.
# text = Police and prosecutors have the tools.
# text = The will is another matter.
# text = Some do, individually.
# text = But institutionally?
# text = That's still the domain of those who don't.
# text = lots of important stories out there today jeff....thank god and a few good souls for that conviction.
# text = Have you sent this to congress yet?
# text = talk about law enforcement not having the will...
# text = CRACKDOWN ON POLYGAMY GROUP
# text = Small polygamous groups have existed in the southwestern US under the watchful yet fairly benign eye of authorities ever since a sect known as the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints (FLDS) separated itself from mainstream Mormonism in 1890.
# text = ...
# text = Now, FLDS leader Warren Jeffs has been added to the FBI's list of "Ten Most Wanted Fugitives," a move that caps law enforcement's dramatic change of approach toward the polygamous group in recent years...[because of] the impact that the group's practices, law enforcement officials say, are having on the most vulnerable within the sect, particularly children and women.
# text = When the FLDS under Mr. Jeffs (and his father before him) grew to some 10,000 followers in several southwestern communities with estimated assets of $110 million; when it became clear that government officials, school authorities, and police in those communities had become intertwined with the sect; when ex-members increasingly reported child and sexual abuse charges (mainly involving underage girls forced to marry older men); and when the sect began to use secluded compounds, state and federal authorities started to crack down more vigorously.
# text = ...
# text = Specifically, Jeffs is charged in Utah and Arizona with sexual assault of underage girls and with arranging "spiritual" marriages for girls and older men.
# text = At weekend press conferences in Salt Lake City and Phoenix, FBI and state officials said Jeffs "is considered armed and dangerous and may be traveling with armed bodyguards."
# text = In the past, he has talked in apocalyptic terms about a violent end to the world, according to former members.
# text = ...
# text = As with Christian Identity and other hate-related philosophies tied to the Aryan Nations and the neo-Nazi Creativity Movement, Jeffs has preached racism as well.
# text = "The black race is the people through which the devil has always been able to bring evil unto the earth," Jeffs has said as cited by the Southern Poverty Law Center's "Intelligence Report."
# text = An editorial in the church-owned Deseret Morning News in Salt Lake City earlier this year acknowledged that "the state's history, a conservative belief in free choice, and an unwillingness to stir up a hornet's nest in the national media have likely all contributed to the kid-glove approach lawmakers and law-enforcement officers have taken when dealing with polygamous communities."
# text = http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0509/p02s01-ussc.html?s=t5
# text = Maybe I'm missing something here, but how, exactly, does one 'Loose' 200,000 AK47's?
# text = "There's no tracking mechanism in place"?!?!?
# text = Never mind.
# text = No need to worry.
# text = I'm sure this kind of thing goes on all the time.
# text = We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming....
# text = just go here, its simply amazing
# text = The Raw Story
# text = i count like 14 explosive headlines.
# text = Then, of course, there is the evidence the jury did not hear about in the Robinson case...
# text = Funny how some things are squirelled away by well-meaning prosecutors...
# text = Maybe because they hint at a larger conspiracy/network of abusers/satanic underground?
# text = I read of a case not long ago when some people were trying to get a polygamous judge taken off the bench for not obeying state law.
# text = Of course law enforcement has dragged it's feet when members are taking part in the activity themselves.
# text = Personally I don't give a damn what adults do to one another as long as there is no abuse invovled.
# text = It is the marrying off of young girls to older men often close relatives that enfurates me.
# text = Also these cults have multimillions yet the women and kids live in poverty so the leaders can live the high life.
# text = In the Warren Jeffs cult he reassigns wives if the husband displeases him or to reward the new husband.
# text = Husbands marry mothers and teen daughters at the same time.
# text = a rare form of retardation is showing up in that group more than anywhere else in the world.
# text = It is genetic and the child needs to get the gene from both parents to turn into a vegetable instead of a thinking child.
# text = The doctor begs them to stop intermarrying but they say they have to keep the blood pure.
# text = look up fumarase deficiency for more info.
# text = Also look up the kingston family.
# text = One member actually was convicted of beating his teen daughter unconcious when she ran away from 'marriage' to her father's own brother.
# text = no one was charged for forced marriage, only the beating.
# text = So we "lost" some weapon?
# text = It's a good thing too.
# text = We wouldn't want those terrorists to run out of shit to shoot at us.
# text = Then the war might stop & all those juicy profits would just evaporate.
# text = What's a few dead soldiers in comparison to keeping all those defense contractors awash in all that tax cash?
# text = They really are milking the incompetence angle though, aren't they?
# text = Just another big Iraq whoopsie daisy, huh?
# text = Christ, you'd think America would get a bit tired of these guys treating her like she was populated with nothing but gullible idiots.
# text = I suppose that it's damn lucky for the GOP that she is populated with gullible idiots.
# text = US outsourcing special ops, intelligence to Iraq terror group, intelligence officials say
# text = The Pentagon is bypassing official US intelligence channels and turning to a dangerous and unruly cast of characters in order to create strife in Iran in preparation for any possible attack, former and current intelligence officials say...
# text = http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/US_outsourcing_special_operations_intelligence_gathering_0413.html
# text = A country deserves the leaders it has, my friends...
# text = And MEK -- the Iranian (not Iraqi) terror group in question -- is itself unquestionably a cult:
# text = As the leaders like to boast, the Mujahedeen is a family affair.
# text = (''We have three generations of martyrs: grandmothers, mothers, daughters.'')
# text = Most of the girls I was meeting had grown up in Mujahedeen schools in Ashraf, where they lived separated from their parents.
# text = Family visits were allowed on Thursday nights and Fridays.
# text = When Iraq invaded Kuwait, many of these girls were transported to Jordan and then smuggled to various countries -- Germany, France, Canada, Denmark, England, the United States -- where they were raised by guardians who were usually Mujahedeen supporters.
# text = When they were 18 or 19, many of them decided to come back to Iraq and fill the ranks of the youngest Mujahedeen generation.
# text = Though ''decided'' is probably not the right word, since from the day they were born, these girls and boys were not taught to think for themselves but to blindly follow their leaders.
# text = ''Every morning and night, the kids, beginning as young as 1 and 2, had to stand before a poster of Massoud and Maryam, salute them and shout praises to them,'' Nadereh Afshari, a former Mujahedeen deep-believer, told me.
# text = Afshari, who was posted in Germany and was responsible for receiving Mujahedeen children during the gulf war, said that when the German government tried to absorb Mujahedeen children into their education system, the Mujahedeen refused.
# text = Many of the children were sent to Mujahedeen schools, particularly in France.
# text = The Rajavis, Afshari went on to say, ''saw these kids as the next generation's soldiers.
# text = They wanted to brainwash them and control them.''
# text = Which may explain the pattern to their stories: a journey to self-empowerment and the enlightenment of self-sacrifice inspired by the light and wisdom of Maryam and Massoud.
# text = Link
# text = One has to wonder whether the bright fellows in our government and military who set up the deals with these people don't know what they are, don't care, or know perfectly well.
# text = Jeff,
# text = SPLOID.com cited you on the topic of that priest conviction: http://www.sploid.com/news/2006/05/evil_priest_gui.php
# text = Umm...
# text = Question Mark
# text = Jimmy Plant, Blogshares is a fantasy blogosphere trading game with pretend money.
# text = That's all I know; I've had nothing to do with it.
# text = Bush successfully makes Satan look good in comparison.
# text = Or something like that.
# text = http://www.laweekly.com/general/features/satan-loves-you/13454/
# text = "Another generation of heavy metal has taken over, and -- sorry -- it ain't just about strippers and dope.
# text = Okay, it's partly about strippers and dope.
# text = And we'll get around to that.
# text = But more and more, as metal evolves into a huge international music that belongs to everyone, it has gotten to be something weirder.
# text = It's become a guardian of morality -- not church morality; real morality.
# text = Praise be: Given the void in responsible behavior among governments, police, educational establishments and religions, the task of guiding our youth down the path of righteousness has fallen to... Satan"
# text = Hmmmmmm....................
# text = The people who carry out these underground arms/drugs/sex trafficking deals are trauma based mind controlled slaves.
# text = The Moldovan airline is Aerocom, and yes, it's one of Victor Bout's.
# text = The wikipedia entry for Aerocom is just a stub .. waiting for someone to put some information into it....
# text = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerocom
# text = So... put some information in there.
# text = You know, nature hates a void. :)
# text = Richard,
# text = i agree, Hmmmmmm.
# text = How are chants of death and suicide ... morality.
# text = What about Manson's tees bearing the message, "Kill your parents".
# text = And were the Columbine killers acting out this "real morality" when they indescriminately murdered their classmates.
# text = They were death metal brainwashed fans, literally fulfilling the death metal paradigm, er ... morality.
# text = (not church morality, no that is phoney, love thy neighbor ... hell no, kill thy neighbor - now that is REAL MORALITY ?????)
# text = So, hmmmm indeed.
# text = I detect the hissing lisp of the lying serpent in this article.
# text = The deathly inversion of truth, ala satanism.
# text = I think the jury's still out on exactly who did the brainwashing when in regard to the Columbine killers.
# text = Perhaps we should look at the death metal phenomenon less as an invitation to violence than as a couter-cultural response to the over hypocrisy of a large percentage of the 'Church-Morality' crowd, which gives a lot of lip service to loving thy neighbor, but doesn't apply that love very far beyond their own congregation.
# text = The last I checked, the Satanists have a long way to go to catch up with the death and destruction dealt out by self-proclaimed (though false) Christians.
# text = Irony is dead...Long live Irony!
# text = That's it.
# text = I'm firing my editor.
# text = Well, it's not as simple and clear cut as all that.
# text = We're entering into some interesting and perhaps previously unexplored socio-political-spiritual territory here that may require further examination and serious introspection.
# text = The Kevin Coogan publication posted on the previous thread might serve as a good launching point for further discussion.
# text = The following quote is from that Coogan article:
# text = Imaginary evil is romantic and varied; real evil is gloomy, monotonous, barren, boring.
# text = Imaginary good is boring; real good is always new, marvelous, intoxicating.
# text = - Simone Weil
# text = Starroute:
# text = I wouldn't wonder too hard.
# text = The answer is likely D: all of the above, due to this being a complex reality we live in.
# text = But to me, without question, they often know perfectly well.
# text = Here is a thought: When the appartently cognitively functional take actions that seem senseless and incompetent, it is a most certain sign that they have ulterior or hidden motives.
# text = They trust you and me to be befuddled by their actions, while they "do as they wilt".
# text = http://youtube.com/watch?v=d46_ctqDmI4
# text = To not buying the BS
# text = & here I am thinking that I really must be getting old.
# text = Since the article was specifically about "death metal" I guess the author missed this little tidbit or we just have waaaaaaaaaaaaay different definitions of morality:
# text = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/4446342.stm
# text = One man's relentless search for his missing son led him to uncover one of the most shocking crimes in post-war Italy - a tale of satanism and violence that has gripped the country for more than a year.
# text = In January 1998 Fabio Tollis and Chiara Marino, both just 16, disappeared.
# text = They had been drinking at a pub called the Midnight - the centre of the heavy metal scene in Milan - and they never came home.
# text = The police and many of their friends just thought they had run off together.
# text = But their parents refused to accept this.
# text = Michele Tollis, Fabio's father, began to attend metal concerts and festivals across Europe, handing out leaflets and quizzing Fabio's friends.
# text = Fabio and his friends were into the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal, music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the story.
# text = No one can contradict me when I say that heavy metal and satanism are closely linked
# text = Michele Tollis
# text = It emerged that Chiara, the girl who disappeared with Fabio, had a collection of satanic literature and paraphernalia in her bedroom.
# text = During this search, Michele Tollis became convinced that satanism had something to do with his son's disappearance.
# text = "No one can contradict me when I say that heavy metal and satanism are closely linked.
# text = They're inseparable," he says.
# text = Yeah, I think Jeff wrote on one of his posts here in the past several months: "To hell with death".
# text = I wholly agree, and would expand that statement to include: "To hell with death metal".
# text = The freaky thing here is that these bozos are seriously claiming the moral high ground ? ? ? ? ?
# text = Talk about a beat-your-head-against-the-wall moment!
# text = And for 'Smartwolf' above, think about the inversion principle being employed.
# text = They are doing it deliberately.
# text = Do you really think GWB, and neocons in general are representative of true followers of Jesus of Nazareth?
# text = (I know, ignorant question) Then why call them, or any other phonies 'Christians', even if they themselves claim the appellation.
# text = They are merely imposters.
# text = Everything they claim is a lie, and this above all.
# text = So why even credit their claims?
# text = This only serves their purposes.
# text = They want to be identified as 'Christians', and I fully suspect that for some of them, the motivation behind their subterfuge is more than mere political advantage, and has a lot more to do with the black magician's practice of the inversion principle.
# text = We need to be more 'rigorous' about how we perceive these people.
# text = See them as they are, not for what they claim to be.
# text = ... the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal, music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the story.
# text = Almost all of the avant guard art movements of the early 20th Century (except for Italian Futurism) were labeled 'degenerate' by the National Socialists.
# text = Adolf Hitler even held an exhibition of 'degenerate art' in 1937, while curating a parallel show of 'Aryan' art across the street.
# text = The German Expressionist movement was destroyed as a result.
# text = Here's a quick overview of the Entartete Kunst (Degenerate Art) exhibit of 1937:
# text = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_art
# text = Ironically (or perhaps not), the notion of the 'degenerate' and 'degenerate art' was appropriated by the Nazis and its origins can be traced back to Jewish 'intellectual' Max Nordau and a 1892 book he authored called Degeneration. .
# text = Nordau was also the co founder of the World Zionist Organization.
# text = When the apparently cognitively functional take actions that seem senseless and incompetent, it is a most certain sign that they have ulterior or hidden motives.
# text = They trust you and me to be befuddled by their actions, while they "do as they wilt."
# text = A question:
# text = Are the adherent of 'Crowleyan Thelema' and others of similar ilk appropriating or appropriating from the appropriators to redirect 'energy?'
# text = Does this reappropriation lead to or originate from the same place?
# text = Seems as if there is a clear distinction being made between the 'imaginary' Whore of Babalon and the actually Whore of Babylon, which is this global system.
# text = Is the distinction accurate and valid?
# text = Does the distinction actually exist?
# text = Confused?
# text = Good.
# text = so, enemy, what's your point?
# text = Why don't you state it?
# text = My point is that these are all just questions and I am undecided as to the answers.
# text = Here's another interesting example:
# text = John Balance from Coil.
# text = (Don't wish to use Wikipedia again, it's just easier than spending time looking up more obscure and detailed information.)
# text = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Balance
# text = http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,3604,1371372,00.html
# text = Balance died in 2004 after a 'fall.'
# text = He blended belief systems such as Shamanism, Christianity, Buddhism, Paganism, Hermeticism and Gnosticism and imbued Coil's vast output with a magickal current designed to have a functionally transcendent effect on listeners.
# text = Not 200,000 guns - the numbers dont work:
# text = 5kg per gun, 200,000 guns means 1000 tonnes, impossible for 4 containers.
# text = If the load was 99 tonnes there were probably less than 20,000.
# text = E@tG:
# text = Maybe if you formulate your questions a little more specifically it will help you in acquiring the answers.
# text = "I am, therefore I think" :)
# text = Reporting from the town where Susan Polk's trial is going on.
# text = I went across the bay last night to attend a farmer's market and music event.
# text = Lo and behold, the Mormons were there with a booth.
# text = Two young men delivering information about the Mormon genealogy program.
# text = Just give your email and/or phone number to these guys and they'll track down your family.
# text = I was amazed at the spiel they delivered.
# text = Kindly young men, but utterly programmed and brain-dead.
# text = I resisted asking any questions that would have required either of them to think.
# text = It would have been too painful to watch.
# text = Has anyone read the letter purportedly from Ahmadinejad to George Bush?
# text = http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/article.asp?id=4503
# text = I don't know if this has been verified.
# text = But succintly making point after succint point, the text of the letter stands on its own merit, regardless.
# text = I like to imagine the thought processes going on in W's head if he were to actually read the letter, but it is hard to picture him actually reading this letter.
# text = As I read the letter, I considered the vast contrast between mind and morality of whoever wrote it, vs. that of the mind of the man who once said "Bring it on!"
# text = America, your condition is dire, dark and deep.
# text = Of the metal music farce, Ministry has definately made in-road into 'Loose Change"-"Alex Jones" territory with their new record, Rio Grande Blood.
# text = Important Kos Diary about bush's response to the gathering storm of scandals:
# text = http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/5/12/232746/857
# text = =Executive Orders -
# text = very creepy, very scary
# text = They have been accumulating for years, and basically give the president to sieze the government whenever he feels like it.
# text = But who would do a thing like that.... hey wait a minute
# text = ==Why did Bush revoke Executive Order 13011 today?
# text = by exmearden
# text = Fri May 12, 2006 at 08:27:46 PM PDT
# text = In scanning the whitehouse.gov site today, I noticed the following Executive Order:
# text = Executive Order: Amendments to Executive Orders 11030, 13279, 13339, 13381, and 13389, and ***Revocation*** of Executive Order 13011....
# text = I can't believe there are no serious metal fans who frequent RI.
# text = I'm wary of jumping into this fray without backup, that's for damn sure. :)
# text = I'm a regular poster but for some reason blogger won't let me in today...but sign me TroubleFunk.
# text = Tronicus:
# text = Simply, the questions permeate the entire 'Western (Mystery) Tradition' and perhaps 'Eastern' as well, as they relate to the confluence of politics and spirituality.
# text = For example, is the system of Crowleyan Thelema a failed alchemical process?
# text = Or was it supposed to initially be a process of alchemical appropriation?
# text = Similarly, is invoking ancient Egyptian gods and goddesses a reaffirmation of an oppressive and hierarchical system?
# text = In my opinion, people can no longer afford to partition out and compartmentalize personal spiritual and political systems.
# text = The 'high weirdness' and more hardcore political 'factions' must perhaps integrate and arrive at a synthesis.
# text = In regards to death metal, the problem is, once again, a question of education, history and the vacuous lack of perspective in American culture.
# text = Shall we censor the works of poet Charles Baudelaire as well?
# text = Baudelaire was perhaps one of the first 'death metal' artists.
# text = Tronicus, if you're still checking this thread:
# text = A bit of a knee-jerk reaction from me there, and I apologize for my over-generalizations.
# text = My real problem is with literalist fundamentalists, of any religion.
# text = True believers are dangerous animals.
# text = I just get hung up on 'Christians', as they're the dominant form where I come from.
# text = Also, I'm quite clear on the fact that those in power now (and, in general, most anyone at the top of a pyrimidal power structure) tend to use the dominant religion as a cloak to hide their true motivations and as a tool to control the masses.
# text = It boggles the mind that ANYONE can take at face value Bush's claims to be a christian, yet many seem to do just that.
# text = I seem to remember something about 'by their works shall ye know them."
# text = I do get my hackles up a bit when people haul out the old 'Rock-N-Roll made them do it' argument.
# text = Whie I don't subscribe to the notion that the things we watch or listen to have no effect on our behavior (which I think is patently rediculous), it does bother me when people single out a specific group of people to pin the blame on.
# text = Sub-cultures (as the lable implies) do not develope in a vacuum.
# text = Again, I think the problem is people who sink to far into their own egos, and begin to take their personal metaphors a bit too literaly.
# text = These people are dangerous wether they're head-banging to 'Canibal Corpse' or humming along to 'Onward Christian Soldiers'.
# text = (The mixing of religion and militarism is a whole other topic....)
# text = I have nothing but respect for people who adhear to non-violence, forgiveness, and charity, but it's important to remember that Christians (or 'Smartwolves') do not have a monopoly on that particular lifestyle.
# text = Peace.
# text = The fact that the US government and media are having a hissy fit over Venezuela wanting to buy guns, and then 200,000 of the guns Chavez wants to buy go missing on their way to Iraq is definitely sus.
# text = I guess those guns will be located enroute to Venezuela or found in storage there by one of the US's local stooges and they then have a pretext to ramp the spin up a notch or two.
# text = Thanks again to my friend Nick Keck for passing this along via e-mail.
# text = It is the text of a speech given by an Arab gentleman before the advisory board of a large multi-nation corporation.
# text = It's a long but very worthwhile read.
# text = "A View from the Eye of the Storm"
# text = Talk delivered by Haim Harari at a meeting of the International Advisory Board of a large multi-national corporation, April, 2004:
# text = "As you know, I usually provide the scientific and technological "entertainment" in our meetings, but, on this occasion, our Chairman suggested that I present my own personal view on events in the part of the world from which I come.
# text = I have never been and I will never be a Government official and I have no privileged information.
# text = My perspective is entirely based on what I see, on what I read and on the fact that my family has lived in this region for almost 200 years.
# text = You may regard my views as those of the proverbial taxi driver, which you are supposed to question, when you visit a country.
# text = I could have shared with you some fascinating facts and some personal thoughts about the Israeli-Arab conflict.
# text = However, I will touch upon it only in passing.
# text = I prefer to devote most of my remarks to the broader picture of the region and its place in world events.
# text = I refer to the entire area between Pakistan and Morocco, which is predominantly Arab, predominantly Moslem, but includes many non-Arab and also significant non-Moslem minorities.
# text = Why do I put aside Israel and its own immediate neighborhood?
# text = Because Israel and any problems related to it, in spite of what you might read or hear in the world media, is not the central issue, and has never been the central issue in the upheaval in the region.
# text = Yes, there is a 100 year-old Israeli-Arab conflict, but it is not where the main show is.
# text = The millions who died in the Iran-Iraq war had nothing to do with Israel.
# text = The mass murder happening right now in Sudan, where the Arab Moslem regime is massacring its black Christian citizens, has nothing to do with Israel.
# text = The frequent reports from Algeria about the murders of hundreds of civilians in one village or another by other Algerians have nothing to do with Israel.
# text = Saddam Hussein did not invade Kuwait, endanger Saudi Arabia and butcher his own people because of Israel.
# text = Egypt did not use poison gas against Yemen in the 60's because of Israel.
# text = Assad the Father did not kill tens of thousands of his own citizens in one week in El Hamma in Syria because of Israel.
# text = The Taliban control of Afghanistan and the civil war there had nothing to do with Israel.
# text = The Libyan blowing up of the Pan-Am flight had nothing to do with Israel, and I could go on and on and on.
# text = The root of the trouble is that this entire Moslem region is totally dysfunctional, by any standard of the word, and would have been so even if Israel had joined the Arab league and an independent Palestine had existed for 100 years.
# text = The 22 member countries of the Arab league, from Mauritania to the Gulf States, have a total population of 300 millions, larger than the US and almost as large as the EU before its expansion.
# text = They have a land area larger than either the US or all of Europe.
# text = These 22 countries, with all their oil and natural resources, have a combined GDP smaller than that of Netherlands plus Belgium and equal to half of the GDP of California alone.
# text = Within this meager GDP, the gaps between rich and poor are beyond belief and too many of the rich made their money not by succeeding in business, but by being corrupt rulers.
# text = The social status of women is far below what it was in the Western World 150 years ago.
# text = Human rights are below any reasonable standard, in spite of the grotesque fact that Libya was elected Chair of the UN Human Rights commission.
# text = According to a report prepared by a committee of Arab intellectuals and published under the auspices of the U.N., the number of books translated by the entire Arab world is much smaller than what little Greece alone translates.
# text = The total number of scientific publications of 300 million Arabs is less than that of 6 million Israelis.
# text = Birth rates in the region are very high, increasing the poverty, the social gaps and the cultural decline.
# text = And all of this is happening in a region, which only 30 years ago, was believed to be the next wealthy part of the world, and in a Moslem area, which developed, at some point in history, one of the most advanced cultures in the world.
# text = It is fair to say that this creates an unprecedented breeding ground for cruel dictators, terror networks, fanaticism, incitement, suicide murders and general decline.
# text = It is also a fact that almost everybody in the region blames this situation on the United States, on Israel, on Western Civilization, on Judaism and Christianity, on anyone and anything, except themselves.
# text = A word about the millions of decent, honest, good people who are either devout Moslems or are not very religious but grew up in Moslem families: They are double victims of an outside world, which now develops Islamophobia, and of their own environment which breaks their heart by being totally dysfunctional.
# text = The problem is that the vast silent majority of these Moslems are not part of the terror and the incitement, but they also do not stand up against it.
# text = They become accomplices, by omission, and this applies to political leaders, intellectuals, business people and many others.
# text = Many of them can certainly tell right from wrong, but are afraid to express their views.
# text = The events of the last few years have amplified four issues, which have always existed, but have never been as rampant as in the present upheaval in the region.
# text = A few more years may pass before everybody acknowledges that it is a World War, but we are already well into it.
# text = These are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict, or perhaps we should already refer to it as "the undeclared World War III":
# text = *1. The first element is the suicide murder.*
# text = Suicide murders are not a new invention but they have been made popular, if I may use this expression, only lately.
# text = Even after September 11, it seems that most of the Western World does not yet understand this weapon.
# text = It is a very potent psychological weapon.
# text = Its real direct impact is relatively minor.
# text = The total number of casualties from hundreds of suicide murders within Israel in the last three years is much smaller than those due to car accidents.
# text = September 11 was quantitatively much less lethal than many earthquakes
# text = More people die from AIDS in one day in Africa than all the Russians who died in the hands of Chechnya-based Moslem suicide murderers since that conflict started.
# text = Saddam killed every month more people than all those who died from suicide murders since the Coalition occupation of Iraq.
# text = So what is all the fuss about suicide killings?
# text = It creates headlines.
# text = It is spectacular.
# text = It is frightening.
# text = It is a very cruel death with bodies dismembered and horrible severe lifelong injuries to many of the wounded.
# text = It is always shown on television in great detail.
# text = One such murder, with the help of hysterical media coverage, can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while, as it did in Bali and in Turkey.
# text = But the real fear comes from the undisputed fact that no defense and no preventive measures can succeed against a determined suicide murderer.
# text = This has not yet penetrated the thinking of the Western World.
# text = The U.S. and Europe are constantly improving their defense against the last murder, not the next one.
# text = We may arrange for the best airport security in the world.
# text = But if you want to murder by suicide, you do not have to board a plane in order to explode yourself and kill many people.
# text = Who could stop a suicide murder in the midst of the crowded line waiting to be checked by the airport metal detector?
# text = How about the lines to the check-in counters in a busy travel period?
# text = Put a metal detector in front of every train station in Spain and the terrorists will get the buses.
# text = Protect the buses and they will explode in movie theaters, concert halls, supermarkets, shopping malls, schools and hospitals.
# text = Put guards in front of every concert hall and there will always be a line of people to be checked by the guards and this line will be the target, not to speak of killing the guards themselves.
# text = You can somewhat reduce your vulnerability by preventive and defensive measures and by strict border controls but not eliminate it and definitely not win the war in a defensive way.
# text = And it is a war!
# text = What is behind the suicide murders?
# text = Money is, money and power and cold-blooded murderous incitement, nothing else.
# text = It has nothing to do with true fanatic religious beliefs.
# text = No Moslem preacher has ever blown himself up.
# text = No son of an Arab politician or religious leader has ever blown himself up.
# text = No relative of anyone influential has done it.
# text = Wouldn't you expect some of the religious leaders to do it themselves, or to talk their sons into doing it, if this is truly a supreme act of religious fervor?
# text = Aren't they interested in the benefits of going to Heaven?
# text = Instead, they send outcast women, naive children, retarded people and young incited hotheads.
# text = They promise them the delights, mostly sexual, of the next world, and pay their families handsomely after the supreme act is performed and enough innocent people are dead.
# text = Suicide murders also have nothing to do with poverty and despair.
# text = The poorest region in the world, by far, is Africa.
# text = It never happens there.
# text = There are numerous desperate people in the world, in different cultures, countries and continents.
# text = Desperation does not provide anyone with explosives, reconnaissance and transportation.
# text = There was certainly more despair in Saddam's Iraq than in Paul Bremmer's Iraq, and no one exploded himself.
# text = A suicide murder is simply a horrible, vicious weapon of cruel, inhuman, cynical, well-funded terrorists, with no regard to human life, including the life of their fellow countrymen, but with very high regard to their own affluent well-being and their hunger for power.
# text = The only way to fight this new "popular" weapon is identical to the only way in which you fight organized crime or pirates on the high seas: the offensive way.
# text = Like in the case of organized crime, it is crucial that the forces on the offensive be united and it is crucial to reach the top of the crime pyramid.
# text = You cannot eliminate organized crime by arresting the little drug dealer on the street corner.
# text = You must go after the head of the "Family".
# text = If part of the public supports it, others tolerate it, many are afraid of it and some try to explain it away by poverty or by a miserable childhood, organized crime will thrive and so will terrorism.
# text = The United States understands this now, after September 11.
# text = Russia is beginning to understand it.
# text = Turkey understands it well.
# text = I am very much afraid that most of Europe still does not understand it.
# text = Unfortunately, it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in Europe in a big way.
# text = In my humble opinion, this will definitely happen.
# text = The Spanish trains and the Istanbul bombings are only the beginning.
# text = The unity of the Civilized World in fighting this horror is absolutely indispensable.
# text = Until Europe wakes up, this unity will not be achieved.
# text = *2. The second ingredient is words, more precisely lies.*
# text = Words can be lethal.
# text = They kill people.
# text = It is often said that politicians, diplomats and perhaps also lawyers and business people must sometimes lie, as part of their professional life.
# text = But the norms of politics and diplomacy are childish, in comparison with the level of incitement and total absolute deliberate fabrications, which have reached new heights in the region we are talking about.
# text = An incredible number of people in the Arab world believe that September 11 never happened, or was an American provocation or, even better, a Jewish plot.
# text = You all remember the Iraqi Minister of Information, Mr. Mouhamad Said al-Sahaf and his press conferences when the US forces were already inside Baghdad.
# text = Disinformation at time of war is an accepted tactic.
# text = But to stand, day after day, and to make such preposterous statements, known to everybody to be lies, without even being ridiculed in your own milieu, can only happen in this region.
# text = Mr. Sahaf eventually became a popular icon as a court jester, but this did not stop some allegedly respectable newspapers from giving him equal time.
# text = It also does not prevent the Western press from giving credence, every day, even now, to similar liars.
# text = After all, if you want to be an anti-Semite, there are subtle ways of doing it.
# text = You do not have to claim that the holocaust never happened, and that the Jewish temple in Jerusalem never existed.
# text = But millions of Moslems are told by their leaders that this is the case.
# text = When these same leaders make other statements, the Western media report them as if they could be true.
# text = It is a daily occurrence that the same people who finance, arm and dispatch suicide murderers, condemn the act in English in front of western TV cameras, talking to a world audience, which even partly believes them.
# text = It is a daily routine to hear the same leader making opposite statements in Arabic to his people and in English to the rest of the world.
# text = Incitement by Arab TV, accompanied by horror pictures of mutilated bodies, has become a powerful weapon of those who lie, distort and want to destroy everything.
# text = Little children are raised on deep hatred and on admiration of so-called martyrs, and the Western World does not notice it because its own TV sets are mostly tuned to soap operas and game shows.
# text = I recommend to you, even though most of you do not understand Arabic, to watch Al Jazeera, from time to time.
# text = You will not believe your own eyes.
# text = But words also work in other ways, more subtle.
# text = A demonstration in Berlin, carrying banners supporting Saddam's regime and featuring three-year old babies dressed as suicide murderers, is defined by the press and by political leaders as a "peace demonstration".
# text = You may support or oppose the Iraq war, but to refer to fans of Saddam, Arafat or Bin Laden as peace activists is a bit too much.
# text = A woman walks into an Israeli restaurant in mid-day, eats, observes families with old people and children eating their lunch in the adjacent tables and pays the bill.
# text = She then blows herself up, killing 20 people, including many children, with heads and arms rolling around in the restaurant.
# text = Dignitaries condemn the act but visit her bereaved family and the money flows.
# text = There is a new game in town: The actual murderer is called "the military wing", the one who pays him, equips him and sends him is now called "the political wing" and the head of the operation is called the "spiritual leader".
# text = There are numerous other examples of such Orwellian nomenclature, used every day not only by terror chiefs but also by Western media.
# text = These words are much more dangerous than many people realize.
# text = They provide an emotional infrastructure for atrocities.
# text = It was Joseph Goebbels who said that if you repeat a lie often enough, people will believe it.
# text = He is now being outperformed by his successors.
# text = *3. The third aspect is money.*
# text = Huge amounts of money, which could have solved many social problems in this dysfunctional part of the world, are channeled into three concentric spheres supporting death and murder.
# text = In the inner circle are the terrorists themselves.
# text = The money funds their travel, explosives, hideouts and permanent search for soft vulnerable targets.
# text = The inner circles are primarily financed by terrorist states like Iran and Syria, until recently also by Iraq and Libya and earlier also by some of the Communist regimes.
# text = These states, as well as the Palestinian Authority, are the safe havens of the wholesale murder vendors.
# text = They are surrounded by a second wider circle of direct supporters, planners, commanders, preachers, all of whom make a living, usually a very comfortable living, by serving as terror infrastructure.
# text = Finally, we find the third circle of so-called religious, educational and welfare organizations, which actually do some good, feed the hungry and provide some schooling, but brainwash a new generation with hatred, lies and ignorance.
# text = This circle operates mostly through mosques, madrasas and other religious establishments but also through inciting electronic and printed media.
# text = It is this circle that makes sure that women remain inferior, that democracy is unthinkable and that exposure to the outside world is minimal.
# text = It is also that circle that leads the way in blaming everybody outside the Moslem world, for the miseries of the region.
# text = The outer circle is largely financed by Saudi Arabia, but also by donations from certain Moslem communities in the United States and Europe and, to a smaller extent, by donations of European Governments to various NGO's and by certain United Nations organizations, whose goals may be noble, but they are infested and exploited by agents of the outer circle.
# text = The Saudi regime, of course, will be the next victim of major terror, when the inner circle will explode into the outer circle.
# text = The Saudis are beginning to understand it, but they fight the inner circles, while still financing the infrastructure at the outer circle.
# text = Figuratively speaking, this outer circle is the guardian, which makes sure that the people look and listen inwards to the inner circle of terror and incitement, rather than to the world outside.
# text = Some parts of this same outer circle actually operate as a result of fear from, or blackmail by, the inner circles.
# text = The horrifying added factor is the high birth rate.
# text = Half of the population of the Arab world is under the age of 20, the most receptive age to incitement, guaranteeing two more generations of blind hatred.
# text = Some of the leaders of these various circles live very comfortably on their loot.
# text = You meet their children in the best private schools in Europe, not in the training camps of suicide murderers.
# text = The Jihad "soldiers" join packaged death tours to Iraq and other hotspots, while some of their leaders ski in Switzerland.
# text = Mrs. Arafat, who lives in Paris with her daughter, receives tens of thousands of dollars per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority, while a typical local ringleader of the Al-Aksa brigade, reporting to Arafat, receives only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollars, for performing murders at the retail level.
# text = *4. The fourth element of the current world conflict is the total breaking of all laws.*
# text = The civilized world believes in democracy, the rule of law, including international law, human rights, free speech and free press, among other liberties.
# text = There are naive old-fashioned habits such as respecting religious sites and symbols, not using ambulances and hospitals for acts of war, avoiding the mutilation of dead bodies and not using children as human shields or human bombs.
# text = Never in history, not even in the Nazi period, was there such total disregard of all of the above as we observe now.
# text = Every student of political science debates how you prevent an anti-democratic force from winning a democratic election and abolishing democracy.
# text = Other aspects of a civilized society must also have limitations.
# text = Can a policeman open fire on someone trying to kill him?
# text = Can a government listen to phone conversations of terrorists and drug dealers?
# text = Does free speech protect you when you shout "fire" in a crowded theater?
# text = Should there be death penalty, for deliberate multiple murders?
# text = These are the old-fashioned dilemmas.
# text = But now we have an entire new set.
# text = Do you raid a mosque, which serves as a terrorist ammunition storage?
# text = Do you return fire, if you are attacked from a hospital?
# text = Do you storm a church taken over by terrorists who took the priests hostages?
# text = Do you search every ambulance after a few suicide murderers use ambulances to reach their targets?
# text = Do you strip every woman because one pretended to be pregnant and carried a suicide bomb on her belly?
# text = Do you shoot back at someone trying to kill you, standing deliberately behind a group of children?
# text = Do you raid terrorist headquarters, hidden in a mental hospital?
# text = Do you shoot an arch-murderer who deliberately moves from one location to another, always surrounded by children?
# text = All of these happen daily in Iraq and in the Palestinian areas.
# text = What do you do?
# text = Well, you do not want to face the dilemma.
# text = But it cannot be avoided.
# text = Suppose, for the sake of discussion, that someone would openly stay in a well-known address in Teheran, hosted by the Iranian Government and financed by it, executing one atrocity after another in Spain or in France, killing hundreds of innocent people, accepting responsibility for the crimes, promising in public TV interviews to do more of the same, while the Government of Iran issues public condemnations of his acts but continues to host him, invite him to official functions and treat him as a great dignitary.
# text = I leave it to you as homework to figure out what Spain or France would have done, in such a situation.
# text = The problem is that the civilized world is still having illusions about the rule of law in a totally lawless environment.
# text = It is trying to play ice hockey by sending a ballerina ice-skater into the ring or to knock out a heavyweight boxer by a chess player.
# text = In the same way that no country has a law against cannibals eating its prime minister, because such an act is unthinkable, international law does not address killers shooting from hospitals, mosques and ambulances, while being protected by their Government or society.
# text = International law does not know how to handle someone who sends children to throw stones, stands behind them and shoots with immunity and cannot be arrested because he is sheltered by a Government.
# text = International law does not know how to deal with a leader of murderers who is royally and comfortably hosted by a country, which pretends to condemn his acts or just claims to be too weak to arrest him.
# text = The amazing thing is that all of these crooks demand protection under international law, and define all those who attack them as "war criminals," with some Western media repeating the allegations.
# text = The good news is that all of this is temporary, because the evolution of international law has always adapted itself to reality.
# text = The punishment for suicide murder should be death or arrest before the murder, not during and not after.
# text = After every world war, the rules of international law have changed, and the same will happen after the present one.
# text = But during the twilight zone, a lot of harm can be done.
# text = The picture I described here is not pretty.
# text = What can we do about it?
# text = In the short run, only fight and win.
# text = In the long run, only educate the next generation and open it to the world.
# text = The inner circles can and must be destroyed by force.
# text = The outer circle cannot be eliminated by force.
# text = Here we need financial starvation of the organizing elite, more power to women, more education, counter-propaganda, boycott whenever feasible and access to Western media, internet and the international scene.
# text = Above all, we need a total absolute unity and determination of the civilized world against all three circles of evil.
# text = Allow me, for a moment, to depart from my alleged role as a taxi driver and return to science.
# text = When you have a malignant tumor, you may remove the tumor itself surgically.
# text = You may also starve it by preventing new blood from reaching it from other parts of the body, thereby preventing new "supplies" from expanding the tumor.
# text = If you want to be sure, it is best to do both.
# text = But before you fight and win, by force or otherwise, you have to realize that you are in a war, and this may take Europe a few more years.
# text = In order to win, it is necessary to first eliminate the terrorist regimes, so that no Government in the world will serve as a safe haven for these people.
# text = I do not want to comment here on whether the American-led attack on Iraq was justified from the point of view of weapons of mass destruction or any other pre-war argument, but I can look at the post-war map of Western Asia.
# text = Now that Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya are out, two and a half terrorist states remain: Iran, Syria and Lebanon, the latter being a Syrian colony.
# text = Perhaps Sudan should be added to the list.
# text = As a result of the conquest of Afghanistan and Iraq, both Iran and Syria are now totally surrounded by territories unfriendly to them.
# text = Iran is encircled by Afghanistan, by the Gulf States, Iraq and the Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union.
# text = Syria is surrounded by Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Israel.
# text = This is a significant strategic change and it applies strong pressure on the terrorist countries.
# text = It is not surprising that Iran is so active in trying to incite a Shiite uprising in Iraq.
# text = I do not know if the American plan was actually to encircle both Iran and Syria, but that is the resulting situation.
# text = In my humble opinion, the number one danger to the world today is Iran and its regime.
# text = It definitely has ambitions to rule vast areas and to expand in all directions.
# text = It has an ideology which claims supremacy over Western culture.
# text = It is ruthless.
# text = It has proven that it can execute elaborate terrorist acts without leaving too many traces, using Iranian Embassies.
# text = It is clearly trying to develop nuclear weapons.
# text = Its so-called moderates and conservatives play their own virtuoso version of the "good-cop versus bad-cop" game.
# text = Iran sponsors Syrian terrorism, it is certainly behind much of the action in Iraq, it is fully funding the Hezbollah and, through it, the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad; it performed acts of terror at least in Europe and in South America and probably also in Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia and it truly leads a multi-national terror consortium, which includes, as minor players, Syria, Lebanon and certain Shiite elements in Iraq.
# text = Nevertheless, most European countries still trade with Iran, try to appease it and refuse to read the clear signals.
# text = In order to win the war it is also necessary to dry the financial resources of the terror conglomerate.
# text = It is pointless to try to understand the subtle differences between the Sunni terror of Al Qaeda and Hamas and the Shiite terror of Hezbollah, Sadr and other Iranian-inspired enterprises.
# text = When it serves their business needs, all of them collaborate beautifully.
# text = It is crucial to stop Saudi and other financial support of the outer circle, which is the fertile breeding ground of terror.
# text = It is important to monitor all donations from the Western World to Islamic organizations, to monitor the finances of international relief organizations and to react with forceful economic measures to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism.
# text = It is also important to act decisively against the campaign of lies and fabrications and to monitor those Western media who collaborate with it out of naivety, financial interests or ignorance.
# text = Above all, never surrender to terror.
# text = No one will ever know whether the recent elections in Spain would have yielded a different result, if not for the train bombings a few days earlier.
# text = But it really does not matter.
# text = What matters is that the terrorists believe that they caused the result and that they won by driving Spain out of Iraq.
# text = The Spanish story will surely end up being extremely costly to other European countries, including France, who is now expelling inciting preachers and forbidding veils and including others who sent troops to Iraq.
# text = In the long run, Spain itself will pay even more.
# text = Is the solution a democratic Arab world?
# text = If by democracy we mean free elections but also free press, free speech, a functioning judicial system, civil liberties, equality to women, free international travel, exposure to international media and ideas, laws against racial incitement and against defamation, and avoidance of lawless behavior regarding hospitals, places of worship and children, then yes, democracy is the solution.
# text = If democracy is just free elections, it is likely that the most fanatic regime will be elected, the one whose incitement and fabrications are the most inflammatory.
# text = We have seen it already in Algeria and, to a certain extent, in Turkey.
# text = It will happen again, if the ground is not prepared very carefully.
# text = On the other hand, a certain transition democracy, as in Jordan, may be a better temporary solution, paving the way for the real thing, perhaps in the same way that an immediate sudden democracy did not work in Russia and would not have worked in China.
# text = I have no doubt that the civilized world will prevail.
# text = But the longer it takes us to understand the new landscape of this war, the more costly and painful the victory will be.
# text = Europe, more than any other region, is the key.
# text = Its understandable recoil from wars, following the horrors of World War II, may cost thousands of additional innocent lives, before the tide will turn."
# text = Zawahiri was associated with a faction of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad known as the Vanguards of Conquest.
# text = Zawahiri and the Vanguards of Conquest were seeking to recreate Mohammed's taking of mecca by a small band through violent attacks on Egyptian leaders.
# text = By 1998, Zawahiri had determined that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad should focus on its struggle against the United States and hold off on further attacks against the Egyptian regime.
# text = A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980.
# text = According to senior counter terrorism officials, both here and abroad, among the supporters of these militant islamists were people who blended into society and were available to act when another part of the network requested it.
# text = Al Qaeda, Anthrax and Ayman: Means, Motive, Modus Operandi and Opportunity
# text = Homeland Security
# text = In early June 2003, a Central Intelligence Agency ("CIA") report publicly disclosed that the reason for Mohammed Atta's and Zacarias Moussaoui's inquiries into cropdusters was for the contemplated use in dispersing biological agents such as anthrax.
# text = An early September 2003 Newsweek article included a rumor by a Taliban source that at a meeting in April 2003 Bin Laden was planning an "unbelievable" biological attack, the plans for which had suffered a setback upon the arrest of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed ("KSM").
# text = He had been captured the previous month in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.
# text = In November 2003, a report by a UN Panel of experts concluded that Al Qaeda is determined to use chemical and biological weapons and is restrained only by technical difficulties.
# text = In a statement issued June 16, 2004, the 9/11 Commission Staff concluded that "Al Qaeda had an ambitious biological weapons program and was making advances in its ability to produce anthrax prior to September 11.
# text = According to Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet, al Qaeda’s ability to conduct an anthrax attack is one of the most immediate threats the United States is likely to face."
# text = On August 9, 2004, it was announced that in the Spring of 2001, a man named El-Shukrijumah, also known as Jafar the Pilot, who was part of a "second wave," had been casing New York City helicopters.
# text = Photographs from a seized computer disc included the controls and the locks on the door between the passengers and pilot.
# text = In a bulletin, the FBI noted that the surveillance might relate to a plot to disperse a chemical or biological weapon.
# text = The CIA reportedly has been quietly building a case that the anthrax mailings were an international plot.
# text = This is old news.
# text = It's just no longer bureaucratically impolite to openly contest the FBI's (former) theory about a lone, American scientist.
# text = Many people have argued that a US-based Al Qaeda operative is behind the earlier Fall 2001 anthrax mailings in the US, and that the mailings served as a threat and warning.
# text = Princeton islamist scholar Bernard Lewis has explained that while islamists may disagree about whether killing innocents is sanctioned by the laws of jihad, extremists like Zawahiri agree that notice must be given before biochemical weapons are used.
# text = "The Prophet's guidance," says Michael Scheuer, an al-Qaeda analyst who recently retired from the CIA and once headed its Bin Laden unit, "was always, Before you attack someone, warn them very clearly..." The anthrax mailings followed the pattern of letters they sent in January 1997 to newspaper branches in Washington, D.C. and New York City, as well as symbolic targets.
# text = The letter bombs were sent in connection with the detention of the blind sheik Abdel Rahman and those responsible for the earlier World Trade Center bombing in 1993.
# text = Handwritten notes and files on a laptop seized upon the capture of KSM, Al Qaeda's #3, included a feasible anthrax production plan using a spray dryer and addressed the recruitment of necessary expertise.
# text = What your morning paper did not tell you, however, was that the CIA seized a similar disc from Ayman Zawahiri's right-hand, Ahmed Salama Mabruk, 5 years earlier.
# text = The computer disk was confiscated from him during his arrest by the CIA in Azerbaijan and handed over to the Egyptian authorities.
# text = Mabruk, at the time, was the head of Jihad's military operations.
# text = There is a risk that observers underestimate the time that Al Qaeda has had to make progress in such recruitment and research and development.
# text = Some may still think that even in the final stages of the 9/11 plot, Zacarias Moussaoui was going to fly a 5th plane into the Capitol or White House.
# text = Others argue that he was to be part of a second wave of airliners directed to targets on the West Coast.
# text = There is an e-mail by Moussaoui, however, dated July 31, 2001 indicating that he sought to take a crop dusting course that was to last up to 6 months.
# text = In March 2003, Mohammed reportedly said that Moussaoui was not going to be part of 9/11 but was to be part of a "second wave."
# text = Although Ramzi Binalshibh provided him $14,000 in July, accused September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui told his trial judge that he had an al Qaeda mission that would have come after the terrorist attacks.
# text = KSM explained that Moussaoui's inquiries about crop dusters may have been related to the anthrax work being done by US-trained biochemist and Al Qaeda operative, Malaysian Yazid Sufaat.
# text = Zacarias Moussaoui, never the sharpest tool in the shed and thought by his superiors to be unreliable, has told the judge at his trial in a filing that he wants "anthrax for Jew sympathizer only."
# text = Al Qaeda's regional operative, Hambali, who was at a key January 2000 meeting and supervised Sufaat, has been captured.
# text = Hambali reportedly is cooperating to some degree.
# text = KSM and Hambali sent al-Hindi (al-Britani), along with Jafar the Pilot, to case NYC targets for a second wave.
# text = It was as part of that surveillance in early 2001 that Jafar the Pilot studied tourist helicopters in the NYC area.
# text = Sufaat, according to both KSM and Hambali, did not have the virulent US Army Ames strain that would be used.
# text = That would require someone who had access to the strain.
# text = But if experience is any guide, nothing would stand in the way of Dr. Ayman Zawahiri's decade-long quest to weaponize and use anthrax against US targets that was described by one confidante to an Egyptian newspaper reporter.
# text = The islamist had been released from Egyptian prison and had known Zawahiri well for many years.
# text = Emails from Zawahiri to Atef in the Spring of 1999 indicate that Ayman was a close student of the USAMRIID anthrax program.
# text = He believed that the koran instructed that a jihadist should use the weapons used by the crusader.
# text = "What we know is that he's always said it was a religious obligation to have the same weapons as their enemies," former CIA OBL unit counter terrorism chief Michael Scheuer has said.
# text = The Wall Street Journal reported that a computer used by Zawahiri contains a June 1999 memo that "said the program should seek cover and talent in educational institutions, which it said were 'more beneficial to us and allow easy access to specialists, which will greatly benefit us in the first stage, God willing.' ''
# text = Zawahiri was associated with a faction of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad known as the Vanguards of Conquest.
# text = Zawahiri and the Vanguards of Conquest were seeking to recreate Mohammed's taking of mecca by a small band through violent attacks on Egyptian leaders.
# text = By 1998, Zawahiri had determined that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad should focus on its struggle against the United States and hold off on further attacks against the Egyptian regime.
# text = A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980.
# text = According to senior counter terrorism officials, both here and abroad, among the supporters of these militant islamists were people who blended into society and were available to act when another part of the network requested it.
# text = A few days before Christmas 2003, after a renewed audiotape threat by Zawahiri of attacks, to include in the US homeland, the threat level was raised to orange or "high."
# text = After the alert condition had long since returned to yellow, Zawahiri in late February issued another audiotape.
# text = He urged the President that brigades and brigades would be coming under the banner of jihad carrying death and seeking paradise.
# text = Zawahiri said that the US should expect another 9/11 on US soil.
# text = According to some reports, Zawahiri is thought by intelligence to be somewhere near the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan.
# text = At one time, some thought he had been spotted in Iran.
# text = Wherever he is, authorities need to focus on the traceable connection between him and those he or Atef recruited.
# text = In October 2001, did the FBI profilers know of the draft message Khalid Mohammed had on the seized laptop (from 1995) that was signed "Khalid Sheik Bojinka"?
# text = The letter threatened to use biochemical weapons if the blind sheik was not released.
# text = (Khalid Mohammed's involvement dates back to Bojinka, as does Hambali's).
# text = Use of biochemical weapons as blackmail and threatened retaliation for such detentions was an alternative scenario in the Bojinka planning.
# text = In May 2004, Patrick Hughes, Lieutenant General (Retired), Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis, Homeland Security Department testified before the 9/11 Commission.
# text = He explained that interrogations and other evidence revealed that Al Qaeda wanted to strike the US with a nonconventional weapon, most notably anthrax.
# text = The same week, the WTC head testified that while they had not received any briefing on the use of planes, they had taken steps to prepare for an attack using anthrax based on intelligence that had been received.
# text = Al Qaeda has had anthrax, the raw seed product in its unweaponized form, since at least 1997, when it was purchased by Bin Laden through the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ("Moro Front" or "MILF").
# text = Zawahiri, Al Qaeda's #2, is head of Al Qaeda's biochemical program.
# text = The CIA has known of Zawahiri's plans to use anthrax for a half decade.
# text = The confidante and right-hand man of Dr. Ayman Zawahiri admitted that Zawahiri succeeded in obtaining anthrax and intended to use it against US targets.
# text = Another senior Al Qaeda member (a shura or policy-making council member no less) was working for the Egyptian intelligence services and he confirmed the report in a sworn lengthy confession.
# text = Even Zawahiri's attorney in 1999 said that Bin Laden and Zawahiri were likely to resort to the biological and chemical agents they possessed given the extradition pressure senior Al Qaeda leaders faced.
# text = A recently released islamist who had been a close associate of Zawahiri said that Zawahiri spent a decade and had made 15 separate attempts to recruit the necessary expertise to weaponize anthrax in Russia and the Middle East.
# text = The US Army recipe was not used, and obtaining the unprocessed Ames strain of anthrax used does not warrant the weight given it by some press accounts.
# text = There was lax control over the distribution of the Ames strain that was used, especially in light of the fact that transfers were not even required to be recorded prior to 1997.
# text = Significantly, the individual who isolated it nearly a quarter century ago (now retired), upon being contacted, does not even report that he necessarily sent the only copy of the strain to Ft. Detrick.
# text = Senator Patrick Leahy at a Congressional hearing in the Spring of 2002 noted that the FBI had collected the Ames strain from 20 sources.
# text = In Fall 2004, MSNBC, relying on an unnamed FBI spokesperson, reports that the FBI has narrowed the pool of labs known to have had Ames that was a match from 16 to 4 but cannot rule out that it was made overseas.
# text = Al Qaeda's anthrax production plans on Khalid Mohammed's computer did not evidence knowledge of advanced techniques in the most efficient biological weapons.
# text = At least according to the public comments by bioweaponeer experts William Patrick and Kenneth Alibek, under the optimal method, there is no electrostatic charge.
# text = In the case of the anthrax used in the mailings, there was an electrostatic charge.
# text = Although there was a dominance of single spores and a trillion spore concentration, there were clumps as large as 40 - 100 microns.
# text = (Spores must be no bigger than 5 microns to be inhalable.)
# text = Many point to the trillion spore concentration as extraordinary.
# text = It is far simpler, however, to achieve a trillion spore concentration in the production of a few grams than in industrial processing typical of a state sponsored lab.
# text = The "trillion spore" issue was at the heart of a lot of mistaken theories of the matter concluding that state sponsorship was necessarily indicated.
# text = The reported finding at Dugway undermines the argument of both the "bomb Iraq" crowd and the liberals focused on Dr. Steve Hatfill who object to US biodefense research because they view it as being useful for offensive purposes.
# text = USDA employee Johnelle Bryant first told us, in sensational detail, of Atta's inquiries about purchasing and retrofitting a cropduster.
# text = Khalid Mohammed then told interrogators that Zacarias Moussaoui's inquiries about crop dusting may have related to Yazid Sufaat's anthrax manufacturing plans.
# text = Although the details of the documents on Mohammed's computer may (or may not) point to possible difficulties in aerial dispersal, they are fully consistent with the product used in the anthrax mailings.
# text = Al Qaeda had both the means and opportunity.
# text = US-trained Malaysian biochemist Yazid Sufaat met with 9/11 plotters and two hijackers in January 2000.
# text = Sufaat was a member of Al Qaeda and a member of Jemaah Islamiah ("JI").
# text = JI has ties with the Moro Front.
# text = Sufaat used his company called Green Laboratory Medicine to buy items useful to Al Qaeda.
# text = (Green symbolizes "Islam" and Prophet Mohammed's holy war).
# text = Zacarias Moussaoui, who had a crop dusting manual when he was arrested, stayed at Sufaat's condominium in 2000 when he was trying to arrange for flight lessons in Malaysia.
# text = Yazid Sufaat provided Moussaoui with a letter indicating that he was a marketing representative for Infocus Technologies and allegedly provided him $35,000.
# text = The crop dusters were to be part of a "second wave."
# text = After 9/11, Yazid Sufaat traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan to work for the Taliban Medical Brigade and to continue his work with anthrax.
# text = As described in US News, a former reporter from the Kabul Times actually may have met Sufaat, without realizing it, while traveling near Kabul in October 2001, perceiving him as Filipino.
# text = The fellow was carrying papers from Zawahiri and bragging about his ability to manipulate anthrax.
# text = Sufaat was arrested in December 2001 upon his return to Malaysia.
# text = Newsweek reported that a "second wave" involving biological attacks had been thwarted upon the arrest of Al Qaeda members who had been intended to provide logistical support.
# text = Various doctors, both foreign and American, are associated with Al Qaeda leaders or operatives, to include the doctors Abdul Qadoos Khan, a bacteriologist from Rawalpindi and Aafia Siddiqui, PhD, from Karachi.
# text = Microbiologist Abdul Qadoos Khan was charged along with his son, Ahmed, for harboring the fugitives.
# text = As of March 28, 2003, he was in a hospital for a cardiac problem and had been granted "pre-arrest bail."
# text = Yet all you read about at the time was the arrest of the son Ahmed Abdul Qadoos, who receives a stipend from the UN for being officially low-IQ due to lead poisoning.
# text = It was Khalid Mohammed who told authorities about Aafia Siddiqui, who has a PhD from Brandeis in neurology.
# text = The Pakistani press reported that she was nabbed in Karachi after being spotted at the airport in late March or early April 2003.
# text = If mistaken, how did those reports first come about?
# text = Understandably, Amerithrax is a confidential investigation.
# text = The Pakistan ISI and CIA rarely grant press interviews in connection with an ongoing manhunt.
# text = The CIA did not even allow the FBI access to KSM for 10 days after his arrest.
# text = As agent Van Harp, then head of the Amerithrax investigation said, the information coming from Khalid Mohammed is classified with the authorities releasing only certain limited information.
# text = While it's not easy to separate fact from fiction, Attorney General Ashcroft and Director Mueller have publicly confirmed Aafia is still being sought.
# text = They would know.
# text = Her mother Ismat last saw Aafia and her grandchildren before they left in a minicab at the end of March.
# text = Aafia was on her way with her children to visit and uncle and a friend in Islamabad.
# text = According to the Pakistan reports, Aafia Siddiqui was detained after being spotted at Karachi International airport (after she was followed to a relative's house).
# text = (Karachi is in the south).
# text = The reports say she is suspected of having been a member of Al Qaeda's "Chemical Wire Group."
# text = The family's lawyer advises me that Aafia did not have enough money to pay for airfare tickets for herself and the kids and called Ismat from the train station.
# text = That was the last Ismat heard from her.
# text = Aafia never reached the uncle's house.
# text = Perhaps something got lost in the translation, but the phrase "Chemical Wire Group" has appeared in all the english Pakistan and India papers.
# text = The family's attorney advises me that Aafia had no knowledge of chemicals (and that would not appear to be her training).
# text = There still is a very hot pursuit of the "Atta-level" Floridian, Adnan El Shukrijumah, who Siddiqui is thought to have known and been assisting.
# text = His nickname is "Jafar the Pilot."
# text = A senior DOJ official reports that Adnan has experience as a commercial pilot.
# text = He is said by one FBI agent to be "very, very, very" dangerous.
# text = He allegedly was at one or more meetings in the Summer of 2001 in Pakistan at which KSM and Sufaat were present.
# text = He may have been seen in Hamilton, Canada -- along with Egyptian al-Maati, who apparently also has received pilot training.
# text = The United States truly no longer has time for faulty analysis or politically-based preconceptions.
# text = In early June 2003, a CIA report concluded that the reason for Atta's and Zacarias Moussaoui's inquiries into cropdusters was in fact for the contemplated use in dispersing biological agents such as anthrax.
# text = It has long been known Osama Bin Laden was interested in using cropdusters to disperse biological agents (since the testimony of millennium bomber Ahmed Ressam).
# text = The hijacker Ahmed Alhaznawi appears to have contracted cutaneous anthrax in Afghanistan.
# text = It is reasonable to credit his statement that he got the lesion after bumping into a suitcase he was carrying at a camp in Afghanistan.
# text = The lesion is further evidence of Al Qaeda's anthrax production program at Kandahar.
# text = The present evidence relating to Atta's alleged travel to Prague does not warrant a conclusion that Al Qaeda obtained the Ames strain from Iraq.
# text = Iraq, however, remains a possible source of the Ames.
# text = Former Russian bioweaponeer Ken Alibek has said that a key Russian scientist assisted Iraq and that Russia had the Ames strain.
# text = (His conclusion may have been based on the fake mobile biolab plans foisted upon the US by the Chalabi associate "Curveball", which Alibek divined to be identical to Russian mobile lab design).
# text = Zawahiri did travel to Baghdad in 1998 with an entourage to attend the birthday party of Saddam's son.
# text = The papers found at headquarters of the Mukhabarat, Iraq's secret police, show that an entourage from Al Qaeda group was sent to the Iraqi capital in March 1998 from Sudan.
# text = According to at least some reports, Bin Laden rejected the suggestion of a closer alliance -- preferring to pursue his own concept of jihad.
# text = Two top Iraqi scientists, code named Charlie and Alpha, are helping the coalition to learn more about Iraqi's anthrax program, according to Dr. David Kay, head of the Iraq survey group in charge of the hunt for WMD.
# text = He has said that the Iraqis made surprising innovations in the milling and drying processes needed to weaponize anthrax.
# text = The media coverage has been seriously confused on the issue of motive and the reason Senators Daschle and Leahy would have been targeted -- tending to simplistically view them as "liberals."
# text = Zawahiri likely targeted Senators Daschle and Leahy to receive anthrax letters, in addition to various media outlets, because of the appropriations made pursuant to the "Leahy Law" to military and security forces.
# text = That money has prevented the militant islamists from achieving their goals.
# text = Al Qaeda members and sympathizers feel that the FBI's involvement in countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Indonesia, and the Philippines interferes with the sovereignty of those countries.
# text = According to a post she made on the internet, Aafia Siddiqui expressed the same sentiment in connection with US appropriations sought in exchange for the extradition of WTC 1993 plotter Ramzi Yousef from Pakistan.
# text = Senator Leahy was Chairman of both the Judiciary Committee overseeing the FBI and Appropriations Subcommittee in charge of foreign aid to these countries.
# text = In late September 2001, it was announced that the President was seeking a blanket waiver that would lift all restrictions on aid to military and security units in connection with pursuing the militant islamists.
# text = This extradition and imprisonment of Al Qaeda leaders, along with US support for Israel and the Mubarak government in Egypt, remains foremost in the mind of Dr. Zawahiri.
# text = At the height of the development of his biological weapons program, his brother was extradited pursuant to a death sentence in the "Albanian returnees" case (now he faces retrial).
# text = It's hard to keep up with the stories about billion dollar appropriations, debt forgiveness, and loan guarantees to countries like Egypt and Israel and now even Pakistan.
# text = Those appropriations pale in comparison to the many tens of billions in appropriations relating to the invasion of Iraq.
# text = Al Qaeda had a motive in mind.
# text = In his Fall 2001 book titled Knights under the Banner of the Prophet, Zawahiri argued that the secular press was telling "lies" about the militant islamists -- to include the suggestion that the militant islamists were somehow the creation of the United States in connection with expelling the Russians from Afghanistan.
# text = Zawahiri argued instead that they have been active since the assassination of Anwar Sadat in Egypt because of the Camp David Accord and the resulting peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
# text = The anthrax letters were sent on the date of the Camp David Accord and then the date Anwar Sadat was assassinated as if to underscore the point to anyone paying attention.
# text = Most of the "talking heads" on television, however, knew only that Daschle and Leahy were liberal democrats and did not know anything of Al Qaeda beyond what they read in the US newspapers.
# text = The FBI's profile includes a US-based supporter of the militant islamists.
# text = Attorney General Ashcroft explained that an "either-or" approach is not useful.
# text = The media has tended to overlook the fact that when the FBI uses the word "domestic" the word includes a US-based, highly-educated supporter of the militant islamists.
# text = There is an emerging consensus that anthrax was contained in a letter to AMI, the publisher of the National Enquirer -- in a goofy love letter to Jennifer Lopez enclosing a Star of David and proposing marriage.
# text = A report by the Center for Disease Control of interviews with AMI employees (as well as detailed interviews by author Leonard Cole) supports the conclusion that there were not one, but two, such mailings containing anthrax.
# text = (The letters were to different AMI publications -- one to the National Enquirer and another to The Sun).
# text = (News assistant Bobby Bender recalls the letter containing the items to have been addressed to The Sun.)
# text = This tactic of letters is not merely the modus operandi of these militant islamists inspired by Zawahiri, it is their signature.
# text = The islamists sent letter bombs in January 1997 to newspaper offices in New York City and Washington, D.C..
# text = They were sent in connection with the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center and the imprisonment of the blind sheik, Sheik Abdel Rahman.
# text = The former leader of the Egyptian Al-Gamaa al-Islamiya ("Islamic Group"), he was also a spiritual leader of Al Qaeda.
# text = The letter bombs were sent in connection with the treatment of the Egyptian islamists imprisoned for the earlier attack on the WTC and a related plot.
# text = The purpose of the letter bombs -- which resulted in minimal casualty -- was to send a message.
# text = (There initially was an outstanding $2 million reward -- under the rewards for justice program, the reward now is up to $5 million.).
# text = There was no claim of responsibility.
# text = There was no explanation.
# text = Once one had been received, the next ten, mailed on two separate dates, were easily collected.
# text = Sound familiar?
# text = Two bombs were also sent to Leavenworth, where a key WTC 1993 defendant was imprisoned, addressed to "Parole Officer."
# text = (The position does not exist).
# text = Abdel Rahman's son was captured in Quetta, Pakistan in mid-February 2003.
# text = That arrest in turn led to the dramatic capture of Khalid Mohammed, Al Qaeda's #3.
# text = Mohammed allegedly was hiding in the home of the Pakistani bacteriologist Dr. Abdul Qadoos Khan.
# text = Along with Zawahiri, Abdel Rahman and his two sons have had considerable influence over Bin Laden.
# text = He reportedly treated them like sons.
# text = Although while in jail in the early 1980s, Zawahiri caused considerable tension by challenging the blind sheik's ability to lead a coalition of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Egyptian Islamic Group, Zawahiri and OBL are Rahman's friends.
# text = The imprisoned WTC 1993 plotter Yousef was KSM's nephew.
# text = Thus, the leaders in charge of Al Qaeda's anthrax production program had a close connection to those imprisoned in connection with the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center.
# text = According to the controversial "Feith memo," which summarized purported intelligence showing an Iraqi/Al Qaeda connection, Osama Bin Laden had asked Iraqi intelligence for technical assistance in sending letter bombs a half year before the Al Hayat letters were sent.
# text = Just because Al Qaeda likes its truck bombs and the like to be effective does not mean they do not see the value in a deadly missive.
# text = As Brian Jenkins once said, "terrorism is theater."
# text = A sender purporting to be islamist sent cyanide in both early 2002 and early 2003 in New Zealand and ingredients of nerve gas in Belgium in 2003.
# text = There's even a chapter titled "Poisonous Letter" in the Al Qaeda manual.
# text = The "Federal Eagle" stamp used in the anthrax mailings was a blue-green.
# text = It was widely published among the militant islamists that martyrs go to paradise "in the hearts of green birds."
# text = In the very interview in which they admitted 9/11, and described the codes used for the four targets for the planes, the masterminds admitted to the Jenny code, the code for representing the date 9/11, and used the symbolism of the "Green Birds."
# text = Osama Bin Laden later invoked the symbolism in his video "The 19 Martyrs."
# text = A FAQ on the Azzam Publications website explained that "In the Hearts of Green Birds" refers to what is inside.
# text = The mailer's use of "Greendale School" as the return address for the letters to the Senators is also revealing.
# text = A May 2001 letter that Zawahiri sent to Egyptian Islamic Jihad members abroad establish that Zawahiri used "school" as a code word for the Egyptian militant islamists in his correspondence.
# text = Green symbolizes Islam and was the Prophet Mohammed's color.
# text = By Greendale School, the anthrax perp was being cute, just as Yazid Sufaat was being cute in naming his lab Green Laboratory Medicine.
# text = "Dale" means "river valley."
# text = Greendale likely refers to green river valley -- i.e., Cairo's Egyptian Islamic Jihad or the Islamic Group.
# text = The sender probably is announcing that he is of either Egyptian Islamic Jihad, Egyptian Islamic Group or Jihad-al Qaeda, which is actually the full name of the group after the merger of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and al Qaeda.
# text = At the Darunta complex where jihadis trained, recruits would wear green uniforms, except for Friday when they were washed.
# text = In a Hadith the Messenger of Allah explains that the souls of the martyrs are in the hearts of green birds that fly wherever they please in the Paradise.
# text = As to opportunity, though seldom reported, there is a wealth of "open source" information about possible Al Qaeda or Egyptian Islamic Jihad or Egyptian Islamic Group in the United States and Canada.
# text = The public information mostly relates to those suspected sleepers who have been detained or who are at large and are being sought.
# text = Zawahiri's mission in the United States in 1995 was to do spadework for terrorism, not fundraising for charitable causes.
# text = He traveled under an alias and was accompanied by a former US Army sergeant named Ali Mohammed.
# text = What mosques exactly did they visit and who did they meet?
# text = Whatever your political persuasion, the FBI and CIA deserve our support.
# text = We are, after all, in this together.
# text = First, the nature of such an investigation is that we lack sufficient information to second-guess (or even know) what the FBI is doing.
# text = Media reports are a poor approximation of reality because of the lack of good sources.
# text = Second, hindsight is 20/20.
# text = Third, with the "new age" Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. in charge of the investigation, it is not likely we could do better in striking the appropriate balance between due process and national security.
# text = Finally, the "Hatfill theory" seems to have been exhausted or at least lost public favor.
# text = The "Hatfill theory" accusing Dr. Stephen Hatfill was always highly dubious.
# text = The suspicion was founded on many false premises, and there was no reliable publicly known evidence indicating his guilt.
# text = The FBI's fixation on Hatfill (at least as rumored by some reporters) may have stemmed from a warning by one Senator that careers hung in the balance.
# text = Leahy's chief of staff apparently started with the strong predisposition that some right-winger was involved because two liberal democrats had been targeted.
# text = The Hatfill theory -- to include ongoing interviews and ongoing 7/24 surveillance by 8 surveillance specialists -- is now the subject of pending civil rights and libel claims of uncertain merit.
# text = A suit against the New York Times and columnist Nicholas Kristof was dismissed in late November 2004.
# text = The judge had agreed to delay the civil rights matter from proceeding until at least October 2004.
# text = The Hatfill Theory ironically might best be understood as an Al Qaeda theory, with a coincidental Malaysian connection adding to the other circumstances.
# text = Given the regrettable leaks that he was under suspicion, it is only fair that the FBI leak with equal enthusiasm the fact that Dr. Hatfill has now been dropped as a suspect if and when that proves to be the case.
# text = A search of Dr. Ken Berry's residences likely will prove just about the last gasp of a biodefense insider theory.
# text = Senior officials have been quoted in the press as saying that the searches were for the purpose of excluding him as much as including him.
# text = Maureen,
# text = Andre is going to look over the list of curves needed for the global assets (August Board meeting) one more time before I forward it to you.
# text = He will make sure that we do not request FX and inflation (CPI,PPI, etc.) curves when only one of the curves will actually be used in the valuation process and to determine which inflation index is needed.
# text = Typically, we receive both FX and inflation from you, but both curves may not always be used.
# text = I hope that we can give you some time savings by eliminating any nonessential requests.
# text = For now, this is the list of countries for which we will probably need the FX and/or inflation curves.
# text = I will send the specifics per Andre later today.
# text = India
# text = Philippines
# text = Bolivia
# text = Jamaica
# text = Guatemala
# text = Venezuela
# text = Columbia
# text = Puerto Rico CPI only (I need historical inflation data, as well)
# text = Panama
# text = Brazil we have current data already
# text = China we have current data already
# text = Euro inflation only
# text = I am not certain about the needs for the London Underwriting/IV group but will request the information from them if you have not done so already.
# text = Thanks!
# text = Cindy
# text = David and Cindy,
# text = Please send us the list of the curves that you will need to revalue our international assets for the August Board meeting.
# text = Thanks,
# text = Maureen
# text = Philip,
# text = I have to decline the invitation with regrets.
# text = I have too many commitments right now.
# text = Vince Kaminski
# text = Dear Vince
# text = Just a quick message to follow up on the email that I sent you recently inviting you to speak at our forthcoming congress, Risk 2001 Australia, which is taking place in Sydney on 20 & 21 August 2001.
# text = Have you had an opportunity to consider the invitation yet?
# text = We are aiming to have the programme printed next week, so I would really need to know as soon as possible if you would be available to speak at this year's congress.
# text = I am working from our Hong Kong office for this week only (Tel: +852 2545 2710), and I can be contacted by phone there or by email.
# text = Kind regards.

# text = Beth has made our reservations for the Round Table Friday night (5/18) at Sullivan's Steak House for 6:30.
# text = See you all there - this is ling overdue

# text = FYI
# text = Vince
# text = Anne, Mike will call you regarding Sarah.
# text = Vince,
# text = As I mentioned in my voice mail, Mike Roberts going to hire Sara Woody, a recent MBA grad from Rice, into his group.
# text = However, when we were talking about this position, Mike compared Sara to Elena.
# text = Elena's title is admin coordinator, and I know that Sara should not have this title, and honestly do not think that Elena should also.
# text = Admin coordinator's do primarily administrative work.
# text = I suggest that you compare Elena and Sarah's duties/ level to other Sr. Spec. in your group such as Kenneth Parkhill and Sevil to determine if they are equivalent, or if their scope of responsibilities and experience is not as broad.
# text = If the latter is the case, we could place both Sara and Elena in a specialist job group ( the salary range is 33-66K).
# text = Please advise.
# text = Thanks,
# text = Anne
# text = Clayton,
# text = Thanks a lot.
# text = I appreciate all your help.
# text = Vince
# text = Vince-
# text = Good news.
# text = Martin's box is working wonderfully- I'll have everything transferred to it and give him the keys by Friday.
# text = This was (another) nice deal for Enron.
# text = We save $21,000 in real money this way, the cash refund Sun is giving Enron for our other server, using a box that wasn't being used by anyone.
# text = I'm happy about this.
# text = Clayton
# text = Iris,
# text = Congratulations.
# text = Anne, please, include this info in Iris' file
# text = Vince
# text = Michael:
# text = Thanks for putting the paperwork together.
# text = I would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment opportunities that I don't have access to now.
# text = Most of my contact with financial advisors in the past has consisted of them suggesting a mutual fund, telling me to invest in Home Depot, Sun, and Coke, or trying to pass off their banks' biased research reports as something valuable.
# text = The above services provide no value to me personally.
# text = If you can present opportunities such as access to private equity or hedge funds, or other ideas with strong growth potential and low correlation to the S@P, I'd listen.
# text = John
# text = John -
# text = We'll get the paperwork together and sent to you for naked options.
# text = At some point, I'd like to talk about the diversification strategy in more detail -- perhaps over dinner or a quick meeting after the markets close?

# text = Appreciate the idea.
# text = However, with my natural long, I'm not looking to really trade around the position.
# text = I believe ENE will continue to be range bound, but in case it is not, I don't want to forgo 50% of my option premium.
# text = I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE and will use calls to implement the stategy.
# text = To that regards, I noticed I was not approved to sell naked calls.
# text = I would like that ability in order to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options.
# text = Please look into that for me.
# text = John.
# text = John -
# text = I was looking at the recent pullback in ENE and thinking it might be an opportunity to buy back the calls you sold.
# text = Of course, you would then be in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce.
# text = I'm not sure that ENE @ 75 is the place, but maybe @ 73.
# text = Call me if you're interested.

# text = Please note that effective immediately my email address has changed to Sean.Cooper@ElPaso.com
# text = He just rescheduled to Wednesday.
# text = How about dinner on Wednesday after that ?
# text = Your buddy Beau invited me.
# text = How about prior to that or after that on Tuesday.
# text = not really...
# text = already have plans on thursday .
# text = are you going to the NYMEX candidate cocktail hour Tuesday?
# text = oh god is there an agenda.
# text = Would dinner Thursday work instead.
# text = not really...
# text = already have plans on thursday .
# text = are you going to the NYMEX candidate cocktail hour Tuesday?
# text = oh god is there an agenda.
# text = Wednesday doesn't work for me.
# text = How about Tuesday's at 3:30 Houston time.
# text = i completely agree.
# text = I would like to have a meeting once a week for 1-2 hours with all 6 of us just to make sure we are moving forward and to get an update and anything and everything.
# text = My only concern is that we take the boys away from their overwhelming task.
# text = What do you guys think.
# text = John
# text = OK.
# text = I will have to move my weekly meeting to Tuesday.
# text = Monday's starting next week at 4???????????????
# text = Wednesday doesn't work for me.
# text = How about Tuesday's at 3:30 Houston time.
# text = i completely agree.
# text = I would like to have a meeting once a week for 1-2 hours with all 6 of us just to make sure we are moving forward and to get an update and anything and everything.
# text = My only concern is that we take the boys away from their overwhelming task.
# text = What do you guys think.
# text = John
# text = Not yet.
# text = Did you happen to sign your employment agreement?
# text = Please respond to request below.
# text = Thanks.
# text = John Lavorato has requested the attached report.
# text = He is concerned about the allocation amongst categories- in particular, Real Time Traders.
# text = If you would, please review the entire list and let me know if you are in agreement with the presentation by tomorrow evening, if possible.
# text = I'm at xif you have any questions.
# text = Thanks!
# text = I understand all of those comparisons, however, the reality is if we lose Dean (which we will if we don't pay 65k + 10k), we will end up hiring a replacement at 75-80k.
# text = This is pretty easy math for me.
# text = I know it seems like a stretch, but the market for hourly traders is very strong right now.
# text = I would like to get this done ASAP.
# text = Thanks.
# text = I am reviewing the request for an employment agreement renewal on Mark Dean Laurent.
# text = Juan communicated some numbers to me and when reviewing this request would like to ask you to consider the following:
# text = Current Salary: $47,500
# text = Job Group: Specialist
# text = YE PRC Rating: Satisfactory
# text = Original Proposition:
# text = Base Salary 65k
# text = 1 Year Agreement
# text = $5,000 signing
# text = Revised Proposal:
# text = Base Salary: 55k
# text = 1 Year agreement
# text = $5,000 signing
# text = Business Case: If we offered Dean 55k or 60k it would still constitute a over a $10,000 increase (approximately 25%) and taking into consideration he was rated as satisfactory at the specialist level.
# text = Also, the top of the salary range for a specialist is 66k.
# text = It would still give him room to progress in the current job group should he not be promoted.
# text = Secondly, he will still out price performers that you have in the same job group that are excellent and strong performers respectively eg. Paul Thomas, Jason Choate, Todd DeCook and Peter Makkai.
# text = Salary Listing in Job Group:
# text = Maria Valdes superior $62,500
# text = Paul Thomas excellent $55,008
# text = Jason Choate excellent $60,008
# text = Todd DeCook strong $42,008
# text = Peter Makkai strong $47,500
# text = Let me know your thoughts....then I will run it by Oxley.
# text = Are we going to attend?
# text = Transmission Expansion and Systems in Transition Conference Feb. 5-8, 2002, Miami, Florida
# text = OVERVIEW
# text = This conference will examine the business and regulatory challenges to U.S. electric systems in transition in effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC 's RTO initiatives.
# text = The conference will review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.
# text = It will examine technology options and new business models for transmission expansion.
# text = It will analyze emerging proposals for effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods.
# text = The conference will also discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and regional trading system.

# text = I need to check something in 969's 2000 tax return.
# text = Who has the 2000 tax return file for 969?
# text = Essie
# text = Sonya City
# text = 07/30/2001 05:17 PM
# text = <Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>
# text = I think that this is for you since I don't know any of these people.
# text = WHO: Enron
# text = WHAT: Happy Hour for John Suarez
# text = WHEN: Today at 5pm
# text = WHERE: The Front Porch 217 Gray St. (713) 571-9571
# text = WHY: Today is John's last day at EBS.
# text = This is NOT an Enron-sponsored event.
# text = How do you feel about taking on another company?
# text = Essie and Leon have proposed xferring Co. 1691 to your world (see below).
# text = Do you concur?
# text = Please let me know Monday morning.
# text = Regards,
# text = Vicsandra
# text = If you have not already made these decisions, Essie's guidance should be helpful.
# text = Patty Lee Corporate Tax x35172 EB1774
# text = Please see my comments in red below.
# text = Essie
# text = Essie,
# text = Can you recommend where these companies each fit within the new organization?
# text = If possible, can you also give an indication of the rank - 1 through 5?
# text = Thanks,
# text = Patty
# text = I have a few entities that may need to change groups or be assigned to a group.
# text = 18T - EI Indonesia Operations LLC
# text = This entity is not in TIS, SAP, nor Hyperion.
# text = The 2000 tax return has no income, assets, or liabilities.
# text = There is a corporate data sheet for this company, but this entity seems to have been inactive since it's creation.
# text = 86M - Enron Net Works LLC
# text = Despite the name, this entity appears to be a MTM company.
# text = Per September financials, this company has about $3M of MTM and about $8K of expenses, nothing else.
# text = The next 5 companies were my responsibility while in EBS, and did not get assigned during the reorg.
# text = 80Y - Enron Broadband Acquisition, Inc.
# text = This entity was created in 2000 for the acquistion of WarpSpeed Communications (now Enron WarpSpeed Services, Inc. 83N), and then dissolved upon completion of merger.
# text = Company is around with a small amount of assets and liabilities, but no I/S items.
# text = 83N is my responsibility.
# text = I think this entity should stay with 83N.
# text = So I suggest it be assigned to Leon.
# text = It should be 4 - easy.
# text = 1579 - EBS Network Co. Division of 17H.
# text = This one should possibly be assigned to Networks & Services group.
# text = Not currently on our list of companies.
# text = I think this could go to either Holding/Administrative Companies (Same as 17H) or Network & Services (Leon).
# text = 4 - easy.
# text = 1691 - EPI-EBS Europe
# text = Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities.
# text = Broke out the activities of 1179.
# text = A similar entity (1179) was assigned to Commodity and Trade (Todd Richards and Mary Fischer) so this one should be assigned to them as well.
# text = 4 - easy.
# text = 1307 - EBIC-Apache, LLC
# text = Rolls up to Cherokee Finance VOF, a CFC.
# text = Cherokee Finance VOF is assigned to North America (Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker).
# text = Maybe this one should also go to them as the only tax which may have to be provided would be foreign tax.
# text = 4 - easy.
# text = 1689 - EPI-EBS Ventures, LLC
# text = Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities.
# text = Broke out the activities of 1307.
# text = Same as 1307.
# text = It should be assigned to North America (Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker).
# text = 4 - easy.
# text = Let me know if you have any questions.
# text = Leon Branom Senior Tax Analyst Networks and Services (713) 345-8702 office leon.branom@enron.com
# text = No problem about moving Company 1691 over
# text = I see that it is a 4, so that will be no problem.
# text = How do you feel about taking on another company?
# text = Essie and Leon have proposed xferring Co. 1691 to your world (see below).
# text = Do you concur?
# text = Please let me know Monday morning.
# text = Regards,
# text = Vicsandra

# text = Can you recommend where these companies each fit within the new organization?
# text = If possible, can you also give an indication of the rank - 1 through 5?
# text = Thanks,
# text = Patty
# text = Virginia,
# text = Hello.
# text = I was originally inquiring about purchasing a Cross or Signac impressionist lithograph.
# text = I found them and purchased both from a gallery in London, William Weston.
# text = They should be delivered this week.
# text = They are beautiful and will add a lot to our collection.
# text = By the way the Lichtenstein is up and hanging in our formal living room and it is magnificent.
# text = I have also purchased an Appel in the last month.
# text = I am interested in several artists.
# text = Actually, a lot.
# text = I will be looking for one or more of the following.
# text = My concept is that overtime I would like to own one of all the following artists and they are all depending when I find something that we really like.
# text = I listed all of our (sometimes mine vs. my wife's favorites and priorities).
# text = They are kind of in rank order but as I stated if I find the piece that I like we will purchase it.
# text = I want signed and numbered.
# text = I realize that some were not signed by the artist but it is an important fact in my buying decision.
# text = I also realize that some may not have done any works on paper or they are outrageously expensive.
# text = For example, I would like to know if Rothko or Kline did any work on paper.
# text = At least that is what I am thinking now.
# text = Bonnard (colorful only)
# text = Lautrec
# text = Suerat (any works on paper? -
# text = I don't know that he did any)
# text = Other impressionist or post impressionist lithos
# text = Braque
# text = Moore
# text = Arp
# text = Rouault
# text = Modrian
# text = Rothko
# text = Kline
# text = Motherwell
# text = By the way, I am interested in re-looking at a Picasso (although we have 2) that your gallery had a couple of years ago.
# text = It was a cubist piece from the 1920s and I believe you called the technique a "push wa" (pronunciation Vs an attempt at the proper spelling).
# text = It was for sale in a couple of galleries in SF and was about $20,000.
# text = Is there 1 available?
# text = Also I am still thinking about the Matisse we discussed before but as you can see, I have a lot of other artists I am interested in and it may remain on the back burner because we already have one.
# text = Thanks,
# text = mike
# text = Huskers drool over Sooners.
# text = 01/19/2001 09:14 AM
# text = Huskers rule, Sooners drool.
# text = 01/19/01 07:55 AM
# text = Thanks for the note.
# text = Sooners rule.

# text = I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today.
# text = I may have to postpone again, I'll let you know later this morning.
# text = I am out all weekend and we have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday night so I may be working over lunch.
# text = Actually, I think we are in pretty good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I have to cancel.
# text = Ken
# text = PS Your brother told me he went to 3 bowl games (when I found out that two of them were the galleryfurniture.com bowl and that one in Shreveport (I can't remember the name of it)) I realized he is a very, very sick college football fan.
# text = Jeff, here is the intial draft.
# text = Please leave as a word document and make any changes and additions that you think necessary.
# text = I haven't even changed the wording after I first put it down.

# text = I will put this on our calendars.
# text = Too bad you won't make the Compaq thing, but maybe next year.
# text = San Antonio, wow what a let down from the other cities.
# text = That will be a nice time of year though.
# text = I can recommend some good restaurants since I took Ric there last year for his birthday.
# text = We stayed at the Menger and had a great time.
# text = 09/20/2000 04:18 PM
# text = This Friday - Michael goes for a visit at St. Francis, which may be his new school (so far, so good).
# text = I'll be in around1000
# text = Most Fridays I'm going to TRY to pick Michael up since I'm away so much, which means leaving by 445 or so.
# text = October 4, ENA orientation in the am.
# text = October 19/20, Neil is out of town, so I have to pick Michael up from school (leave at 430)
# text = October 26/27, hope to be vacation time.
# text = Neil has a meeting in San Antonio (usually it is in Miami, San Francisco, Phoenix - not so great this year).
# text = It is the officer's meeting for Enterprise, and spouses are invited.
# text = This means we won't be in town for the Compaq thing.
# text = Figures, of course.
# text = Thanks for asking.
# text = I'm watching for some good vacation days, also...
# text = fyi/review/comment
# text = I have a couple of questions so I can wrap up the LOI:
# text = We refer to licensed Fuel Cell Energy equipment.
# text = Do we intend to reference a particular manufacturer, or should this be more generic?
# text = Do we want to attach a draft of the Development Agreement, and condition the final deal on agreeing to terms substantially the same as what's in the draft?
# text = I have a concern that the Enron optionality bug could bite us on the backside with that one.
# text = Do we expect to have ONE EPC contract, or several?
# text = I'm looking for the confidentiality agreement, which may be in Bart's files (haven't checked closely yet).
# text = If anyone has it handy, it could speed things up for me.
# text = Thanks,
# text = Kay
# text = Forget the ONE or more contract questions.
# text = I see we expect to have separate contracts for each project.
# text = I have a couple of questions so I can wrap up the LOI:
# text = We refer to licensed Fuel Cell Energy equipment.
# text = Do we intend to reference a particular manufacturer, or should this be more generic?
# text = Do we want to attach a draft of the Development Agreement, and condition the final deal on agreeing to terms substantially the same as what's in the draft?
# text = I have a concern that the Enron optionality bug could bite us on the backside with that one.
# text = Do we expect to have ONE EPC contract, or several?
# text = I'm looking for the confidentiality agreement, which may be in Bart's files (haven't checked closely yet).
# text = If anyone has it handy, it could speed things up for me.
# text = Thanks,
# text = Kay
# text = On the issue of the contracts, the draft says that the $170m is paid when the EPC contract is signed.
# text = Are we expecting that the portion attributable to each project will be paid as the individual EPC contracts are signed?
# text = Thanks,
# text = Kay
# text = 1. The pricing that we have given CRRA is specific to FuelCell Energy and would not be meaningful without listing the manufacturer (i.e., ONSI would be a lot more money).
# text = Hence, I think that we have to reference the manufacturer.
# text = 2. The attachment of the Development Agreement is a Jeff question.
# text = In order to mark any 2000 income, we will need to get CRRA to execute the Development Agreement in 2000.
# text = In my opinion, we should show CRRA a copy of the LOI with the assumption that the Development Agreement is attached.
# text = I would actually send them the draft Development Agreement a couple days after the LOI.
# text = Based on how CRRA reacts, I would make an ultimate determination if the agreement needs to be attached to the LOI.
# text = 3. I expect at least one EPC contract per project.
# text = We don't want to condition the acceptance of one project on the performance of another project.
# text = Performance tests will either be performed on a project basis or a unit by unit basis in a given project.
# text = Remarkably clear explanation.
# text = FYI, see below.
# text = Mom's birthday is tommorow.
# text = What are we going to get her?
# text = Chris
# text = That is some good stuff.
# text = I hear you are coming our way soon.
# text = Look forward to drinking a few beers.
# text = Chris
# text = Michael McDermott <Michael.McDermott@spectrongroup.com> on 06/01/2000 06:00:56 AM
# text = Yo Mama`s so fat ....
# text = Your mama is so fat: When she hauls ass she has to make two trips.
# text = When she dances she makes the band skip.
# text = When she was diagnosed with the flesh eating disease the doctor gave her 13 years to live.
# text = She puts mayonnaise on aspirin. (<- clearly the winner)
# text = Her cereal bowl came with a lifeguard.
# text = When she goes to the zoo the elephants throw her peanuts.
# text = Her high school graduation picture was an aerial photograph.
# text = Her driver`s license says "Picture continued on other side."
# text = She has to iron her pants on the driveway.
# text = The back of her neck looks like a pack of hot dogs.
# text = Yo mama`s so fat, all the restaurants in town have signs that say: "Maximum Occupancy: 240 Patrons OR Yo Mama" Yo mama`s so fat, when she ran away, they had to use all four sides of the milk carton.
# text = Yo mama`s so fat, instead of Levis 501 jeans, she wears Levi`s 1002`s.
# text = Yo mama`s so fat, when she gets in an elevator, it HAS to go down.
# text = Yo mama`s so fat, she was born with a silver shovel in her mouth.
# text = Yo mama`s so fat, she`s got smaller fat women orbiting around her.
# text = Yo mama`s so fat, she could sell shade.
# text = You will have to wait and see :-)
# text = Done!
# text = Expect a call from Paul tonight.
# text = Chris
# text = What are some good interview questions?
# text = Poll your co-workers.
# text = cd
# text = I told Paul that you called him yesterday so abruptly because you didn't want to waste his time while you got tests done for arthritis.
# text = I told him I told you to call him back and at least hear what he has to say.
# text = He said they are looking for people and based on what I told him an interview was a formality.
# text = Chris
# text = Is that Microwave that you gave Dan really expensive?
# text = All the guys at work are saying I shouldn't bother having it fixed I should just buy a new one.
# text = Chris
# text = Jai Hawker 974-6721
# text = I won't forget about the $.
# text = Do I need to cross reference the deals in my model to the deals in the system or did you already do that?
# text = Chris
# text = Kathy,
# text = Don't take that deal out until I look at it.
# text = I think it is mine but I forgot to write it in the blue FX book (I only wrote it in my red book).
# text = Thanx,
# text = Chris
# text = Just a reminder to send me a currency report.
# text = Thanx,
# text = Chris
# text = Paul called me today.
# text = He will be in Calgary in a couple of weeks and will interview you then.
# text = Chris
# text = You should reply ASAP.
# text = Don't make Peters and Co. wait.
# text = Chris
# text = I didn't get a chance to talk to Paul today.
# text = Give him a call tommorow.
# text = Chris
# text = Will you please run a June NX3/NX1 for our book.
# text = Paul
# text = How about meeting at 11:30 or 12?
# text = I am in the office so give me a call.
# text = CD 3-1663
# text = The deed is done.
# text = Chris
# text = Find attached resume and cover letter.
# text = Hopefully he didn't spel anyting incorrectly.
# text = Dan is really smart and a hard worker.
# text = I think he would be a good fit.
# text = Give me a call Tuesday afternoon to discuss (gone to Kelowna golfing for the weekend).
# text = Cheers,
# text = Chris
# text = I haven't had a chance to send it yet.
# text = Paul is out of the office today so I haven't had a chance to talk to him.
# text = I'll send it as soon as you resond wether I should or not.
# text = Chris
# text = Are you guys still looking for an analyst?
# text = Should I send the resume to Dawn or you directly?
# text = Chris Enron Canada Corp. Suite 1100, 70 York Street Toronto, Ontario M5J 1S9 416-865-3700

# text = Fernley / Sally
# text = Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle's help ) I have pulled together a one page communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page summary ).
# text = We are in the final stages of this process - where we draft a cover letter for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the Enron Europe newsletter )
# text = Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?
# text = Mike
# text = Late Jan sounds great.
# text = Meagan does have a couple of big things on the weekend in January -- National Charity League Senior Presentation (big dance that she and I are committed to help with), the Bearkadette Ball and a winter party for Cotillion.
# text = I believe that these are three weekends in a row, January 6, 13 and 20th.
# text = So the last weekend in January would work well (and I will need a rest from formal affairs!).
# text = Does that work for you?
# text = And do you want to do it on a Saturday or Sunday?
# text = Saturday probably works better for me, just so that I am back in Houston and doing laundry by Sunday afternoon!!
# text = Hi...
# text = Talked to the little mother-to-be.
# text = She said a shower would be grand.
# text = She has some big presentation mid-January.
# text = How does late January sound to you.
# text = Should we set a date now?
# text = Am I turning into Mother?
# text = Cindy
# text = I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough of a global message and the means of delivery.
# text = On the means of delivery, I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent.
# text = Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article?
# text = With regard to a global message, I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities.
# text = With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide.
# text = These global standards also should enable Enron to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations.
# text = I am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.
# text = Finally, a question regarding timing.
# text = The last I knew after you and Brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) for comments to all business controllers.
# text = I don't believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.
# text = And not to belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards.
# text = My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year.
# text = There is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.
# text = Shona has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has already been working with James New.
# text = So I question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against.
# text = Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful exception report?
# text = Sorry that this response looks so long.
# text = I have been interrupted 20 times while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.
# text = Thanks for sharing this with me.
# text = Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave you some.
# text = --Sally
# text = 11/10/2000 01:04 PM
# text = Steve, I noticed that our allocation from 2000 to 2001 is going up by 21% year on year (ie) $13.9M from $11.5M.
# text = We have been able to keep ENA's direct group expenses flat year on year, we are trying hard to keep the corporate allocation flat year to year as well.
# text = Do you have a view on how we might be able to achieve this goal?
# text = Regards
# text = Delainey
# text = Don't worry about it ... sorry for putting you back on speaker.
# text = I just wanted Sue to hear (she enjoys utility bashing so much).
# text = Thanks for the comment on the hearing.
# text = In some respects I don't think the first panel could have gone much better; everyone thanked FERC for intervening (though for different reasons).
# text = The other staff reports are also looking good.
# text = Scott Miller has been a godsend -- somebody not afraid to tell it like it is.
# text = Jeff Dasovich
# text = Sent by: Jeff Dasovich
# text = 11/10/2000 12:33 PM
# text = I apologize if I offended anyone.
# text = Please let them know that I was simply quoting the CEO of a large, regulated utility in California.
# text = Thanks for attributing the quote to me.
# text = You did a great job at the hearing----it went decidely downhill after you left.
# text = Best,
# text = Jeff
# text = Does she have any interest in meeting one-on-one or is she just looking for a public hanging?
# text = I remain convinced that if we can just get the facts in front of people they will modulate their approach.
# text = Jeff Dasovich
# text = Sent by: Jeff Dasovich
# text = 11/10/2000 12:21 PM
# text = Given the short notice, we will politely decline to participate at the hearing on Monday, but will let the good Senator know that, in general, we intend to engage actively in the process and plan to help California find a solution that works for everybody.
# text = Amen.
# text = See below.
# text = Can we get some help on the IBM issues?
# text = Erin Rice
# text = 11/10/2000 11:08 AM
# text = Steve:
# text = At this point, our IT contacts are backpedalling a bit and suggesting they can overcome the TIBCO and Terminal Server problems.
# text = There are still four important issues, however:
# text = IT still cannot commit to transferring messages across domains.
# text = This means that messages initiated at Corp and intended for the entire Enron organization will not reach any business units outside the Corp domain.
# text = No messages will reach the EES organization unless IBM agrees not to use their proprietary message delivery tool, WebSphere, and will use WebLogic instead.
# text = WebLogic is required by BackWeb, although it is designed by a separate company.
# text = HR, intended to be a key user of this tool, will not use BackWeb because survey responses cannot be made anonymous.
# text = HR has already purchased a tool called CONFIRMIT that can execute anonymous surveys.
# text = Messages will not be delivered simultaneously to all users in the same domain, nor will they be delivered for two to five hours after they are sent by the message administrator.
# text = Another thing to consider is that these messages will be set to expire and disappear within a set period of time, meaning users cannot retrieve them and read them later (as they can with e-mail).
# text = This means that I could be away from the office for several days and miss a message entirely, because it would have expired and disappeared by the time I returned.
# text = The plain fact is that a few members of IT are pushing this initiative, but they lack commercial sponsorship.
# text = They are hoping Corp will foot the bill for a pilot which will allow them to fully test this tool before implementing it company-wide.
# text = Please let us know if you have additional questions.
# text = - er
# text = Steven J Kean
# text = 11/09/2000 11:35 AM
# text = Do we have a sense for how many we can reach, how many we can't and where they are?
# text = Are whole offices (eg Tokyo) unreachable or is it only those who have home offices?
# text = Courtney Votaw
# text = 11/08/2000 11:02 AM
# text = Mark and Steve-
# text = Erin Rice and I would like to meet with you to discuss the issues concerning BackWeb before we proceed.
# text = As you can see from the Design Document, they are pretty significant.
# text = Thanks,

# text = It's a very ambitious site -- with state-of-the-art WSI weather (seasonal, 6-10, and day to day) driving a good load model for PJM and NEPOOL.
# text = ESAI contributes oil and gas input price forecasts, capacity judgments, and "herding" ideas to develop power price forecasts for same time periods.
# text = After one month's full-bore effort, I'm pleased with the results (e.g., we forecast Nepool onpeak to be $43 and it turned out $46).
# text = Have a great weekend.

# text = Joe_Lardy@cargill.com on 03/02/2001 10:39:03 AM
# text = Currently Cargill and Enron have a 15MM collateral threshold.
# text = If possible, I think the cleanest way to run this biz would be to put a box around the prime broker biz.
# text = We would still operate under the master isda but could set up a mutually agreeable credit support annex for this biz.
# text = We would still keep the 20,000,000 line referenced in Schedule B of the POA agreement.
# text = The line in the POA is a seperate and distinct measure from the daily collateral.
# text = The 20 mill reflects gross exposure.
# text = Let me know if you think this is reasonable and workable.
# text = We too, are open to suggestion as the Global and Enron relationships are very important and a high priority to us.
# text = Thanks
# text = Joe
# text = Joe-
# text = a few things regading the POA/ Cargill line..
# text = I am going to find out how much line we currently have available... you probably already have this.
# text = We should allocate a piece to Global which would solve the problem of other Cargill people using the line, putting us over the limit, without me knowing...
# text = We could change the language of the POA to this...
# text = we will not go over Global's piece of the Cargill line...
# text = I think this would solve our main concern...
# text = Please let me know... we are eager to keep trading with Global and yourselves...

# text = Hello -
# text = I spoke with Jeff Hodge yesterday regarding the additional language from Peoples regarding Audit Rights.
# text = His initial reaction was that their request was probably reasonable and in line with the spirit of a jointly owned L.L.C.
# text = However, he did suggest a couple slight revisions to protect Enron's interests.
# text = 1) Highlighting that information will only be provided that is related to enovate and 2) that each designated representative should sign an appropriate confidentiality agreement.
# text = This language has been included in the attached draft.
# text = My goal, however optimistic, is to execute the risk policy by the end of today.
# text = Activity is picking up dramatically and the fine line is getting further blurred each passing day.
# text = Therefore, I need to know ASAP if there are any problems with the draft as written.

# text = It is less complicated for me to initial and fax than to track down someone who doesn't know anything about it and get them to initial it.
# text = I can print it here, initial it, and fax it to whomever you want.
# text = Plus, I work with Janet a lot so she may get some comfort from that, instead of having a lawyer she hasn't dealt with initial it.
# text = She is very conscientious about what she signs, and who initials what.
# text = Is the attached form the final final form?
# text = Where and to whom do you want it faxed?
# text = Thanks,
# text = Kay
# text = Since it will be Janet signing, it will probably be better to have the initials on the pages first.

# text = I can meet around 10:00.
# text = That way, we can get it to them in time for weekend review.
# text = Does that work?
# text = Kay
# text = It was good to hear from you!
# text = We had a nice Thanksgiving here too.
# text = It's funny, because usually it's just me, Mom, Craig and Danelia, and Danelia doesn't really like roasted turkey or roast beef (not that she would say it to me!), so there is not just the same joy in cooking it would be elsewise.
# text = It was good having the girls down.
# text = We played a new version of Uno called "African Uno" that was complex, fast and at times, physically challenging.
# text = It's not for the meek.
# text = It was incredible what a good player Alena was.
# text = She had her cards memorized as well as everyone elses (when you play you'll see why you can know everyone elses hands!).
# text = I expect Craig didn't want Mom to see his place because it was messy.
# text = I think compared to my house, he's embarrased about his apartment.
# text = Then, also, he's got so much stuff in there right now, that I don't know how he's going to fit baby stuff.
# text = They would only give him a 6 month lease when he renewed his lease last month because they don't want 3 people in that small apartment.
# text = So he's going to have to start looking for another place.
# text = I guess Mom is going to come back down sometime in March or April to see the new baby.
# text = You'll have to come visit to check out my new house.
# text = The upstairs "guest suite" is pretty neat.
# text = It's got its own bathroom and tv, and is pretty cozy.
# text = As far as the call with Uncle Ben goes, if he was thrilled to hear from me I couldn't tell by his voice.
# text = It was a pretty stilted conversation for both of us.
# text = But, I guess, it's a start...
# text = I've already made my XMAS plans.
# text = I leave the evening of the 21st, my flight comes in about 10 pm, and leave the morning of the 27th at 6 am.

# text = Anyway, I got you message, and I got the World Series thing (although I had already received
# text = Chris and Ben did a marvelous job for Thanksgiving, I can testify that it was one of the best Thanksgiv8ing Dinners I've ever had (I not gonna tell them that, I don't want them getting swell heads).
# text = Ma said she had a great time in Houston, She was happy to see yourself, as well as C & D.
# text = I think she likes her special room in your house.
# text = Your gonna be the first to see the new baby (woudn't it be wierd if the baby gets botn on Jan 5th?)
# text = Why didn't Craig show Ma his appartment?
# text = What do you think about your phone ocnversation with Unlce Ben (he was almost shocked)?
# text = Are you coming for Xmas?

# text = Attached are the GCP Signoffs on EOL Approvals for 11/29/00 with GCP responses marked in Red.
# text = Adnan Patel
# text = 11/29/2000 04:31 PM
# text = Regards,
# text = bd
# text = Attached is the referenced agreement.
# text = Let me know if the notice information is OK with you.
# text = If so, I'll get it signed by Craig Breslau today, then bring it to you for countersignature.
# text = Thinking about that, what's your title?
# text = I'm not sure you have the authority to sign documents w/o special authority...
# text = No, it does not mean that.
# text = Adding all the Enron "Specified Entities" would only make a default under a financial transaction with those other Enron entities a default under this agreement.
# text = Our concern is that we don't want any trading related defaults to ever trigger a default under a loan transaction which has a swap as a component.
# text = Richard Sage
# text = 11/30/2000 10:52 AM
# text = If you do add all the entities, does that mean that we would not need to put in place a separate agreement for ECCL?
# text = With respect to Deutsche Bank (""DB"), we have one credit issue remaining, DB would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and we are somewhat hesitant to do so, as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement.
# text = Sara and Bill Bradford in Credit are supposed to talk to the DB Credit people about this remaining issue.
# text = With respect to First Union National Bank, the draft we were working from was so old that they agreed to look at our current form of agreement which was sent to them on 11/8/00 for review.
# text = Sara is working on that with Susan Bailey, another paralegal in our Group.
# text = Denis O'Connell
# text = 11/22/2000 06:05 AM
# text = Tana -
# text = can you please give me an update on where you are in the negotiations of the ISDA with the following counterparties and confirm which Enron entity you are negotiating on behalf of.
# text = Tks,
# text = Denis
# text = First Union National Bank
# text = Deutsched Bank AG
# text = I spoke to Mark Taylor about your signing authority, and he agrees that you do not have the authority to execute documents on your own, but as long as you are only co-signing documents signed by an authorized officer as a control measure we're OK.
# text = Susan, Joe,
# text = The referenced TAGG # was entered as a 'New Counterparty', can you please let me know what counterparty this is so we can correctly assess the counterparty exposure.
# text = Thank you,
# text = Russell
# text = Hey there yourself,
# text = Sorry I haven't written you guys in a while to keep you properly updated.
# text = I am indeed checking on flights to Seoul and don't think I'm going to go at exactly the same time as my parents.
# text = As much fun as they are, I figured we would probably do some different things than what you have planned for them.
# text = As for Ted, things are still going well although I haven't see him at all this week (we are two very busy people).
# text = But, we had a great laid back day last Saturday and I think have hit that comfortable stage...you know, not quite so formal about dates etc.
# text = In one sense it's great, but it also makes things a lot harder to read.
# text = Anyway, I'm sure my Mom told you guys but Travis and Kathy got to meet him and I think it went well.
# text = Hopefully, if we're still dating come December, you and Chuck can meet him when you come back to visit.
# text = I'm planning on dragging him to at least one of the U.T. games, I just have to find out when he wants to go (as well as properly prepare him for the Scott/Kelley/Parks/Wild Card gang and the full-day affair that is a U.T. game).
# text = Things in Houston are good and definitely warm.
# text = I went with Emily and her Mom last night to see the musical "Rent" and it was wonderful.
# text = Also, I'm going out to San Diego for the Labor Day weekend to visit Hoot's daughter Julie.
# text = Needless to say I am very excited.
# text = Talk to you guys soon,
# text = Susan
# text = Hey girlie,
# text = How are you doing?
# text = Haven't heard from you in a while.
# text = A little birdie told me that you were checking into tickets for Seoul.
# text = Are you really?
# text = Would you come with your parents or separately?
# text = In any case, we have had some more time to do some exploring (and shopping), so we have some good ideas about what to do if you come.
# text = I think that we will stay in Korea when your parents come and do the whole base thing (which will take only a few minutes, actually), but are considering going to China or somewhere during part of Thanksgiving.
# text = We'll do whatever you want want if you still are coming!
# text = Let us know the latest with Ted and also with what's going on in Houston.
# text = Take care,
# text = Chris

# text = Hey Tonto (a.k.a - the trusty, but silent, side-kick to the Lone Ranger or in this case the Big D)
# text = The play was very good and I think well received.
# text = I'd forgotten how blown away I was by some of the songs the first time I saw it in NY.
# text = The cast members really have to have incredibly powerful voices to pull off a few of the most poignant numbers ( I think this could be your true calling).
# text = I caught the third day of Corey's Jeopardy run last night here at the office (yes, I had to come back after the play...I love my job!).
# text = Anyway, I'm sure I'd mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl.
# text = As a result of that, she has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my enjoyment of playing Trivial Pursuit or watching Jeopardy by absolutely obliterating me (The girl actually did her senior thesis on Trivia).
# text = Kori told me she saw you last night at Steak Night and introduced herself since I failed to do so the last time we went.
# text = I should let you know though that she was very offended this morning that you didn't spell her name right in the email - I mean it's such a common spelling.
# text = So was Darren there last night to meet her or do you just think they'd make a good match?
# text = She's a very fun girl.
# text = Hope you day is going well and that the move to 30 went off without a hitch.
# text = Good luck with all of the "fun" meetings.
# text = Shorty

# text = Ted Noble
# text = 08/17/2000 10:05 AM
# text = How was the play?
# text = I forgot to tell you that I saw your friend on a re-run Jeopardy the other night and I almost called you but it came on at 11:30.
# text = Smart girl.
# text = I ran into Corey last night at LWs and I am thinking this is a girl for Darren.
# text = Anyway, lots of fun meetings today.
# text = I'll talk to you later.
# text = Maybe you should ignore the sentiment of the quote I sent earlier...
# text = I think you may be adhering to it too faithfully.
# text = At this rate we may have to start pinning notes to your shirt to remind you to do things.
# text = However, having driven with you on several occasions I feel confident you will be able to pass the test with flying colors.
# text = Keep in mind though that if you end up failing I will not let you forget it (and, as we have established, I have the memory of an elephant).
# text = I'll keep discussion of me to a minimum and just say that things are well on 32.
# text = Now back to what's really important...you.
# text = Thought you'd like to know that the Dixie Chicks are coming back to Houston Dec. 12 and will performing just down the street from you at the Compaq Center...it's all about you and your needs.

# text = I just found out that I need to take the TX drivers exam both written and on the rode.
# text = This is a two day process and all because I let my CA license expire.
# text = I know I need some of your organizational skills.
# text = I may try to run out and take the test this afternoon while I get moved to 30 (I better not fail it).
# text = How's life on 32 today -- well that's enough about you let's talk more about me.
# text = There is no pleasure in having nothing to do; the fun is in having lots to do and not doing it.

# text = I think it's a good idea since the provisional application is on file - Travis is the internal lawyer who has taken care of the patent application so he will have better ideas for where the words should be placed and appropriate look and feel (I would guess near the copyright notice and roughly equivalent size).

# text = Hi everyone,
# text = I just got of the phone with Hai and he told me how to make an adjustment on a day to day basis in regards to incorrect liquidations but he also explained this is just to make the daily P&L #'s right, if nothing were done the month end P&L would still somehow work out because adjustments would be made.
# text = Does this mean that for June and for a certain portion of July we should not do anything and just make adjustments on a going forward basis (and assume everything will work out at month end)?
# text = If this is the case I would like someone to walk me through June to see if the numbers did really work themselves out as there was a large swing in second order on June 29 that was not adjusted for.
# text = Let me know if one of you could help me do this.
# text = Karim.
# text = Evidently, this a problem that Stacey White has been aware of for a couple of months now.
# text = There was a change made in the coding for the delta position and this has somehow messed up the liq value.
# text = John
# text = John, Karim,
# text = I'm now looking closely at the option liquidation problems.
# text = I believe that there might be a sign-flipping problem for PUTS that 's causing this whole issue.
# text = I'll keep you posted.
# text = Karim - this's likely the explanation to your other question...
# text = I'll get back to you as soon as I have more info (hopefully later today)
# text = Marcelo L. Meira Sr IT Developer Enron Networks - Houston, TX (713) 345-3436

# text = I am looking at the option liquidation report and all of the $65 puts are in the money and the $75 call is also in the money.
# text = Shouldn't all the liquidation values from the beginning of the month be a negative (representing positive liquidation) for the puts?
# text = The liq value for the call is CORRECT.
# text = John
# text = Karim,
# text = I don't want to wait till month end, let's adjust the numbers now and for the June 29 2nd order, lets take that value into June since it relates to July puts.

# text = Topic for panel, "PUC Priorities."
# text = Goal is to (politely?) refute Loretta Lynch's and Carl Woods' continued assertions that 1) California's move to deregulate was based solely on ideology with no basis in fact and 2) the solution is to turn back the clock to command-and-control regulation.

# text = Dear Justin
# text = Marly asked me to respond to you.
# text = As you know, the suffix ONLINE is purely descriptive and now used by many companies.
# text = Therefore, any trade mark registration that incorporates the word ONLINE as a suffix in the way that you use it will not enable its owner to prevent others from using the word ONLINE.
# text = Given the above, if you have adequate protection for the word ENRON (which covers the services that you offer on-line as well as your core activities), I'd say that another application for the words ENRON ONLINE is probably unnecessary.
# text = However, if you use a particular logo for the on-line service, that should be registered.
# text = I hope the above is clear.
# text = Jonathan Day
# text = Marly,
# text = If you could respond to me on this request, thanks
# text = Justin
# text = Paul Goddard
# text = 08/03/2000 11:35
# text = Can one of you give me a quick call to discuss .
# text = I'm @ X37047.

# text = I believe we are to some extent already protected with "Enron" proceeded with anything, but EnronOnline(TM) , etc. just affords us more protection.
# text = I assume this is akin to why McDonald's trademarks "Mc"Everything?
# text = David Forster
# text = 08/03/2000 01:50
# text = Paul,
# text = Can you please give me a call to discuss trademarking?
# text = i.e. Are we covered if we proceed a word with "Enron"?
# text = e.g.: EnronEAuction.

# text = Perhaps you can give them a personal invitation...
# text = We have received the amendment to the BC Gas ISDA Master executed by BC Gas, which adds the Canadian Securities Representation, so we don't have to add the rep into every confirm.
# text = BC Gas won't sign the confirms with the rep in, and this has caused much difficulties.

# text = When you have a minute, I'll give me a call and I'll come around and show you how to unfreeze the panel.
# text = I spoke to Edmund to get the scoop on what we are going to be doing on the confirms for Credit Derivatives, and he said that his current understanding is that all of the confirms will be done out of London.

# text = Wow!

# text = Tori Kuykendall

# text = Please contact me if you require any additional information
# text = Mike
# text = Mike Jordan
# text = 03/04/2001 16:29
# text = The intention of the efforts and actions documented in my earlier update ( see attached email ) was to provide a robust position signoff process for total metal tonnage, spread and brand and location a timely substantiation of stock on balance sheet forward MTM debtors and creditor balances OBSF transactional values and a reconciliation of the barclays intercompany account
# text = Despite the best efforts of IT, continuing problems with the AS400 application, a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock reconciliation reports, and concerns over the useability of the outright stock screen enquiry are such that I am currently not confident of delivering sufficient accurate information to AA to satisfy their audit requirements - which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and forward positions to full accounting values.
# text = Consequently I need to inform you of, and/or require your approval for, the following :
# text = I will discuss with AA the following
# text = that OBSF values within the extended trial balance may be misstated due to data issues ( above and beyond existing conversations with AA on model simplifications)
# text = that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses, AS400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to AA within the audit timetable)
# text = an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped ( see MO work )
# text = The creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards ) for key Metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to meet the above stated objectives
# text = The signoff for additional permanent 'Enron' headcount who will 'duplicate' certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing Traffic staff
# text = A reconciling difference of $15mm exists between the reported DPR and the final accounting p&l as generated on the AS400.
# text = We will continue to investigate potential misstatements in the system p&l, as a result of data or system valuation problems, within the month end reporting timeframe.
# text = However, this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and signoff of system p&l values with traders.
# text = The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet ( reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated.
# text = Middle Office work being prioritised is as follows
# text = the stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23rd - with full reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic/co-ordination an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30th ( replacing planned 23rd review due to system issues ), requiring full download of contract detail for later reference
# text = reconciliation of stock movements between 23rd and 30th sample tests of vanilla forward transactions
# text = detailed position analysis of all OBSF contracts that must be reconciled to Barclays documentation
# text = spreadsheet recalculation of OBSF option premium utilising the above manually created position analysis
# text = the circularisation of Barclays intercompany account and comparison to our cut off and substantiation analysis
# text = the debtors/creditors partial circularisation initiated for close of business 23rd
# text = I will be in touch directly re the items needing approval
# text = Regards
# text = Mike
# text = Mike Jordan
# text = 21/03/2001 18:20
# text = Several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating risk for the Merchanting Metals business.
# text = Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility ("OBSF") which commenced two weeks before the year end.
# text = The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA's signoff for the facility late in the year end audit.
# text = The discovery of a number of 'bugs' within the AS400 Merchanting code, arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality, which compounded the operational burden of supporting the OBSF.
# text = The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ).
# text = The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on gardening leave.
# text = The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting business irrespective of the above parochial business issues.
# text = Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus, gain comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet.
# text = The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting developers.
# text = The AR/AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1.
# text = Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process tracking cash settlement/ funding data to working capital components for all Metals businesses.
# text = An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1 covering gross tonnage, spread positions and summarised analyses for brand and locations.
# text = The necessary report functionality should be available within the AS400, however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical VBA/excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads.
# text = User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements for the support of OBSF.
# text = A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q1 open and Q1 close
# text = A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit timetable which incorporates
# text = A full circularisation of inventory balances, and matching to source documentation within Enron
# text = Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances, by third party inspectors, where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will not be received on a timely basis
# text = Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report signed off by the traders )
# text = Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values
# text = Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) and to AS400 Barclays account
# text = A risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation, where applicable, and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements
# text = A full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or external documentation ( invoices/request for payment )
# text = A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts
# text = A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts
# text = I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during April
# text = If you have any questions please call me on x34703
# text = Regards

# text = I want to make sure that I understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this value would be booked.
# text = As such, please provide the following detail:
# text = Will we be valuing/booking a series of monthly call options or a series of daily call options?
# text = What power curve are we valuing the deal against - PJM East or West Hub?
# text = Please send me the current fuel curve that you are converting to $/MWh to value the deal?
# text = What volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities or intra-day volatilities or a blend of the two (if blending please show me what formula you using to blend the two vols)?
# text = What expiration date are you using, i.e.: for monthly call options the 15th of the relevant month, and for daily options?
# text = What correlation are you assuming, 15% flat for twenty years?
# text = Are you deducting all operating expenses from the value of the option?
# text = Are you using the "SPRDOPT" Exotic Options function to value the option?
# text = Are you using the $/MWh VOM dollar amount as your strike?
# text = Has Don provided the fixed payment stream?
# text = This stream should be covering both P&I and not just principal.
# text = Yvan, and Ben, please provide answers to these question via written correspondence so that their is limited probability of misunderstanding.
# text = Thank you both very much for your time and help thus far.
# text = Furthermore, I would like to reiterate that RAC's goal, prior to quoting any credit reserve, is to be 100% confident that: (i) the methodology that is being employed is consistent among the internal groups; and (ii) the inherent value of the price risk management contracts matches.
# text = This enables RAC to manage the associated risk during the life of the transaction both effectively and appropriately.
# text = Regards,
# text = Christopher
# text = Randy, this is the issue I left you the voice mail on.
# text = Article 6 of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement (which I am sending to you separately) with ECS obligates ECS to "work in good faith with CDEC" to establish an automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading conditions on CDEC's system.
# text = We had a pretty good idea when we signed the contract that ECS would not be able to complete that by the contract start date, so we negotiated a fall back plan under which ECS is obligated to "assist [Transwestern] in developing a manual system to accomplish the same result and will hold harmless and keep [Transwestern] whole for all cost and expenses" associated with the manual system.
# text = We will fight with them about who owes the $200k that James mentions below based on their failure to "assist" us in managing the cost.
# text = In the mean time, we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to mitigate future costs.
# text = Do we have someone who is watching this out there?
# text = We are running so full tilt on TW that we may not have as much flexibiltiy to manage this situation as we expected, but let me know what we can do.
# text = James had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement--I guess between ECS and Transwestern--that would permit ECS to communicate to us the details on how to access teh key info. from CDEC.
# text = That sounds like a BS excuse from ECS, but it that's what they are saying, let me know and we can figure out a solution.
# text = Thanks.
# text = DF
# text = James Centilli
# text = 12/14/2000 02:49 PM
# text = Would you please contact Gerald Nemec and review the Gallup Compression Service Contract in respect to the Load Control Management.
# text = My understanding was that ECS was to provide a means to access CDEC's online profile in order for us to make a decision to avoid running the compressor during CDEC's peak load periods.
# text = We have not received access to this information which has resulted so far in additional electric cost of $200,987.33 for the period of July through September.
# text = Additional cost will be incurred for the remainder of this year, that I have not been able to review yet.
# text = This cost is averaging $79,000 per month if we continue to run the compressor as we have in August and September.
# text = Good point, but I'm comfortable we're covered because our bidders were all bidding on a chunk of capacity and primary points.
# text = They are deemed to be on notice that they had alternate point rights (its in the tariff) and if they wanted to submit a bid that had a different rate for primaries and alternates, they could have done so.
# text = None of them did, and most importantly, the winning bidders did not.
# text = Our letter agreement simply memorializes that we will charge the same negotiated rate whether the gas flows on primaries or alternates.
# text = I assume from your message you are OK with this and they can get it nailed down?
# text = DF
# text = I just got done looking at the underlying contract language as set forth in the pro forma service agreement in the tariff and it specifically says that the max rate would apply unless a discount or negotiated rate has been agreed to.
# text = My concern with adding the language below is, could it be argued that not everyone knew the rate would or could apply at any point, since we just stated Topack and Needles and if they knew they might have bid a different rate??
# text = Susan Scott
# text = 01/11/2001 02:42 PM
# text = After discussions with the commercial group I propose that that redlined language be added to the attached Dynegy agreement and to the 4 other negotiated rate agreements we've done.
# text = If there are any objections you need to get back to me ASAP.
# text = pls print.
# text = df
# text = In discussion with Dave, we thought it would be good to put this together in a format of questions and answers.
# text = However, as you will see, the questions I thought of got kinda long- but I think we need answers for all of them.
# text = One thought is to have just the agenda as a couple topics and then lead in with the first two questions as I've listed.
# text = Please provide me your thoughts asap.
# text = MK
# text = whasssup?
# text = Here it is.
# text = Thanks.

# text = Susan Scott would like authorization to order an Aeron chair for each of her offices - on 47 and 41.
# text = This particular chair is designed to help with back problems, which she has.
# text = Many people at Enron already have this type of chair, but we rarely, if ever, have a surplus because they are so popular.
# text = The cost is $567.77 per chair plus tax.
# text = Please approve the purchase of two.
# text = Thanks!

# text = I believe you got a copy of the John Sommer letter to producers dated Jan 6 that MKM's spies intercepted.
# text = She forwarded the Sommer letter to Stan and discussed it with him.
# text = Dari and I vented our aggravation by drafting the attached letter to Gibson and Kyle complaining of Sommer's duplicity, but after tempers cooled, MKM and I decided not to send it to Stan or urge him to send a written response.
# text = As it stands, MKM and I will probably bring it up with Sommer in OK City and strongly suggest the importance of coordinated communication to the producers.
# text = Stan may also bring the letter up orally next time he's on the phonne with Gibson or Kyle as an example of how not to handle this situation.
# text = Yea--it was outstanding news!
# text = What a hoss.
# text = Can't catch you this time but 14721 keep me posted on your next trip.

# text = However, we have reserved a block of rooms at the nearby Wyndham Hotel.
# text = To reserve one of these rooms, you must inform the Wyndham staff that you are part of the CAEM group.
# text = If you should decide to arrange lodging at a different hotel, please do so quickly as there is limited availability in all surrounding hotels.

# text = Can we have a meeting this week (maybe Thursday at 3:30) to discuss this?
# text = Jim
# text = We do need a formal plan.
# text = We have been working closely together to identify the issues as they develop and propose solutions.
# text = Doug has been providing us with the necessary specific market information.
# text = We have been successful in communicating that information to the new commissioners and Ercot and seeking resolution.
# text = The commission is definitely more responsive to market participants that are articulating the issue, providing specific examples and proposing the solution.
# text = Grand-standing is ignored.
# text = Those who show up with complaints but cannot point to specifics are virtually ignored.
# text = Those who show up and complain, but are not participating in the working groups and the daily Ercot phone calls, board meetings, etc. are ignored.
# text = Doug and I met with the Chairman of PUCT and have had subsequent conversations.
# text = Thane and I also visited with him.
# text = Pat Wood made a phone call to Tom Noel and told him to get the Texas market fixed.
# text = (Even though he has bigger things to do in D.C., this is his legacy and he recognizes that if deregulation does not work in Texas, the repercussions could be global.)
# text = Chairman Sibley and Chairman Wolens (of the Texas legislature) are also engaged in market developments.
# text = We have been working with the State Affairs legislative committee and keeping them apprised.
# text = There is an Electric Restructuring Committee hearing scheduled for September 6th or 7th.
# text = The forum is expected to be invited testimony only.
# text = Those currently listed as invitees are PUCT Commissioners and Ercot's Sam Jones and Tom Noel.
# text = The hearing is focused on the pilot and we have an opportunity to provide some probing questions for Wolens to direct to Sam and Tom.
# text = Now that Sibley is not a candidate for Lt. Governor, there is more freedom to open up and ask some difficult questions.
# text = Thane is in Austin on Friday, but is available by phone.
# text = I will be on a plane to Houston at 8:00 a.m.
# text = Can we find another time that works for us to meet?
# text = Thane is in an Ercot PRS meeting Friday from 9:30 until 3:00.
# text = I am available after Rick's Friday budget meeting...are you available then?
# text = You are right, we do need a formal plan, Thane has started an initial draft.
# text = Thanks, Jean
# text = Jean & Thane --
# text = Walking out last night, Kevin Presto indicated that there were games being played in ERCOT with the new market rules and prices in certain markets were not reflective of working markets.
# text = Enron needs to use this situation to quickly get our viewpoints up into the PUCT and ERCOT ISO on what is driving these problems and our proposed fixes.
# text = If ERCOT goes the way of California - either due to market power or poor market design rules - it will be a bad day for deregulation and for Pat Wood.
# text = As important, the new PUCT Commissioners need some help right now in messaging the market.
# text = Let's get them to support constructive solutions that will make a real difference.
# text = Jean and Thane, I think that we need a FORMAL PLAN on what to do over the next 3 - 6 months to leverage this situation.
# text = I would like to discuss this with you on Friday am.
# text = I am free at 8am on Friday before Rick's budget meeting.
# text = Jim
# text = FYI.
# text = You may want to discuss with Becky.
# text = Jim
# text = As an outgrowth of the meeting Leslie and I had with Scott and Hunter a couple of weeks ago, we have begun work to develop an electronic tool that would allow us to provide ongoing summaries of FERC gas activities, and possibly electric activities, in a format that can be linked to the Fundamentals intranet site used by the traders.
# text = We envision a format that would provide a brief summary and analysis of the order, filing, etc. with a link to the source document as well for those who would like more detailed information.
# text = This would replace the paper copies you and your people are currently getting.
# text = Many details remain to be worked out, but we will keep you advised.
# text = In the meantime, could you please provide a contact on your side with whom we could discuss technical issues?
# text = What do I need to do?
# text = Jim

# text = The application of recent developments in optimization theory and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor fuel.

# text = Please consider whether I might fit in your group.

# text = We informed Tana that we made the change in Global Counterparty to include, "a division of Cargill Incorporated".
# text = We will meet in the near future to discuss the issues surrounding division and trade name setups in Global Counterparty.
# text = Bill
# text = Bill -
# text = If Sam's description below of the GCP procedure is correct, it looks to me like something needs to be changed.
# text = The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from Global Counterparty.
# text = Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names.
# text = If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself.
# text = That is the source of Tana's concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system.
# text = My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed.
# text = In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining.
# text = I would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and, if you have any problem with changing the GCP procedure, please let me know.

# text = FYI...
# text = Cargill Ferrous International is setup correctly in the Global Counterparty System as a Division of Cargill, Inc.
# text = Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as such in GCP with a Sub-to-Legal Link to Cargill, Inc. per GCP procedure.
# text = Also, the Global SAP team (Cheryl Johnson) would need Legal Name Change documentation from the Counterparty in order to change this name.
# text = Best Rgds.
# text = Samuel x3-9890 (GCP) Enron Net Works _ Global Data Management
# text = Any updates on adding the correct legal name to this counterparty name?
# text = Hello,
# text = Yes, GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems.
# text = (Although, we have broken that rule for Legal in the past.)
# text = This defeats the purpose of using a Tradename.
# text = Best Rgds.
# text = Samuel
# text = Tana,
# text = Please review the process below:
# text = With divisions, EOL does request a new Password Application for the applicant reflecting the name as you noted below.
# text = When the company is set up in the EOL database we link the company to the Parent and reference the CP ID.
# text = Sam, please confirm, Global Counterparty also provides the links to establish correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems.

# text = To Whom It May Concern:
# text = Through TV and newspapers , I hear constantly about identity fraud using stolen social security information.
# text = I am very concerned about this issue.
# text = I have the following suggestion for our company.
# text = Since Enron's employees are assigned an SAP identification numbers (P number) and an HR number, could Enron as a company use these IDs instead of the SS numbers?
# text = This will be safer for all employees.
# text = For example, I am concerned when I buy the monthly bus passes and I have to fill in my SS number.
# text = I do not feel secure at all to see my SS in so many databases at Enron, especially when some databases are from third-parties (out-sourcing).
# text = We could use our badge number there instead of our SS.
# text = Please let me know how your organization can help the Enron employees feel safer about the safeguard of their SS number.
# text = Please calendar and print for my files on this meeting.
# text = Thanks.

# text = We understand that the pipe fitters are also planning to picket the Lake Worth, Florida project as well.
# text = Our execution team needs to get some guidance and planning for this picketing should it interfere with the progress of the work.
# text = In that respect, we need to dial in Rick Johnson and Olgletree to plan and communicate that plan to the execution team.
# text = I think the first step is a call between yourself, me, Mark Stubley and Mike Indivero.
# text = And then another call with all folks or a meeting at the jobsite to lay out the plan.

# text = I have heard that the pipefitters have established a picket line at the Payne Creek site today.

# text = Gas Accord II Settlement Participants:
# text = Attached is PG&E's Gas Accord II (GA II) Settlement Proposal.
# text = We believe it addresses many of the issues and concerns you have raised in the workshops.
# text = As an overview, this proposal: * Maintains the basic Gas Accord structure in place today for the period 2003 to 2007. *
# text = * Offers end user transportation rates for 2003 lower for most customers than rates in effect today. *
# text = * Provides for vintaged Redwood path rates for core customers. *
# text = * Offers a 7.5 cent/dth rate to large customers while minimizing rate changes to other customers, minimizing the incentive for these customers to seek to bypass local transmission charges and other CPUC-approved charges. *
# text = * Adopts guidelines to improve reliability and help moderate prices in gas commodity markets, and identifies the capital projects needed to meet these guidelines over the course of the GA II period (2003-2007). *
# text = * Provides a high degree of rate stability, with a 3.5% escalator to capture both inflation and the cost of needed capital projects.
# text = The guaranteed rates will be adjustable only for significant changes in the cost of capital or increased costs due to governmental requirements or catastrophic events. *
# text = * Preserves a rate differential between the Redwood and Baja paths, although somewhat less than the current differential. *
# text = * Proposes a two-stage open season for firm transportation services beginning in 2003, with end users receiving a first option on available capacity. *
# text = * Maintains the core aggregation program with some adjustments.
# text = PG&E also anticipates that the Core Procurement Incentive Mechanism (CPIM) will be similar to today's mechanism, but will reflect the somewhat larger capacity holdings needed to meet anticipated increases in core demand and to meet a 1-day in 10-year cold weather event.
# text = This also will serve as a reminder that an all-Party meeting is scheduled at PG&E's headquarters in San Francisco on January 10 and 11, to discuss this proposal and to respond to your questions.
# text = We look forward to answering your questions and receiving your feedback.
# text = The attached documents include the GA II Settlement proposal, an Attachment (a copy of PG&E's proposed Gas Rule 27), and a set of supporting workpapers.
# text = Finally, please note that the Settlement document and the Attachment are in "Word 2000" format.
# text = We would be glad to provide the same documents in an earlier version of Word, upon request by individual Parties.
# text = We look forward to seeing you on January 10-11.

# text = Harry Kingerski
# text = 12/26/2000 03:33 PM
# text = Jeff -
# text = instead of suggesting a specific rate increase - 10 or 15 %, I think we should acknowledge that a "modest" increase may be necessary and may in fact be desirable - but that the specific amount of increase should be reasoned and subject to well thought out evidence and hearings, not just determined by whim.
# text = In general, we should not be overly prescriptive at this point and I know you agree with that.
# text = Otherwise, I think you have captured the points excellently.
# text = We're in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months.
# text = But while the (otherwise perishable) thoughts are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday, I wanted to throw out some observations for discussion in the days/weeks ahead.
# text = OBSERVATION--The pressure to finger somebody for "price gouging" is increasing.
# text = The administration is hell bent on finding a "fall guy."
# text = The price spikes pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out.
# text = His press release following the hearing renewed the call for "refunds."
# text = On my panel, Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers.
# text = And Carl Wood's remarks were extreme.
# text = At the Barton hearing, a liberal democrat (Filner) and a conservative Republican (Hunter) locked arms in calling for refunds.
# text = Bilbray joined the "gouging" band wagon.
# text = The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a "real" investigation, with hearings, testimony, data discovery---the works.
# text = On the positive side, the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak, his analysis, and his remarks on the panel.
# text = Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of California's market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit.
# text = He also stated that just everyone's just acting in their own self-interest, responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure.
# text = IMPLICATION--It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered.
# text = In the best case, the clamoring for a "refund" subsides.
# text = In which case, the only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the risks of getting fingered.
# text = In the medium case, investigations find that Enron (like others) "played by the rules," but the rules stunk, and Enron profited at the expense of California consumers.
# text = You're right, Sue.
# text = Rates can't go up w/out declaring the rate freeze over in some fashion---trying to finesse it.
# text = Thanks very much for the comments.
# text = Harry also had a good comment---don't specify the amount of rate increase in our comments; rather note that the rate increase needs to be well-reasoned and based on facts and evidence.
# text = Will make that change.
# text = 02/22/2001 04:37 PM
# text = This is a request for your interview participation.
# text = The Associate and Analyst Programs will be on the Penn, undergraduate campus interviewing summer Analyst interns next week.
# text = Due to business reasons, previously scheduled interviewers from the Penn team have had to cancel their participation.
# text = Currently, I need three interviewers for Thursday, March 1st and one interviewer for Friday, March 2nd.
# text = Please let me know of your availability.
# text = Campus interviews are scheduled as follows:
# text = Place: University of Pennsylvania
# text = Date: Thursday, March 1st Friday, March 2nd
# text = Day One Interviews Day Two Interviews
# text = Where: On Campus Inn at Pen
# text = Time: 8:00 - 5:00 8:00 - 5:00
# text = Interviewers: Kevin McGowan- confirmed
# text = Jen Fraser- confirmed
# text = Margaret Rhee- confirmed
# text = Chris Hilgert- confirmed
# text = In the event that you have scheduling conflicts and cannot participate, any referrals at the Director or VP level would be greatly appreciated.
# text = As always, thank you for your time and please contact me @ ext 58369 if you have any questions.
# text = Shawna Johnson Recruiting Coordinator
# text = Sorry about that before.
# text = I'll not say anything.
# text = Best
# text = Jeff
# text = "Scott A. Kushnick" <skush@swbell.net>
# text = 01/26/2001 12:48 PM
# text = Please don't mention my NY trip to anyone.
# text = Keep in touch.
# text = Scott
# text = thanks for the update.
# text = have you gotten a price?
# text = Doug Leach
# text = 01/25/2001 09:40 AM
# text = fyi
# text = Tom Byargeon, Kevin Miller and Ken Loch in ENA are working with producers in the US involved in deep water offshore Louisiana/Texas oil and gas drilling projects.
# text = This financing activity was primarily started to help ENA secure long term well head and pipeline natural gas supplies to supplement the gas trading desk activities.
# text = Just like what happened in Enron's initial VPP program they are find more interest in oil drilling projects rather than natural gas projects.
# text = They are currently working on a bid (due 1/31) for the Medusa project which involves Murphy (operator), Agip and Callon in Mississippi Canyon Blocks #538 and #582.
# text = The initial reservoir reports estimate reserves of 80-120 million barrels of sour crude and they estimate initial production to be 40,000 bpd starting in 1Q 2003.
# text = Quality is estimated to be a Mars type crude with 25-27 API Gravity and 1.5-2.0% sulfur.
# text = Plans are to build a private pipeline to Equilon's West Delta #143 platform and then bring the oil onshore.
# text = Peggy is finding out where WD #143 pumps to onshore.
# text = Tom's group would like to know if we have any interesting in buying the crude on either a fixed or floating basis.
# text = The floating could be tied to a Platt's index or the NYMEX.
# text = It is far too early to expect Murphy to enter into a physical or financial contract, but Tom hopes to get us first and/or last look from Murphy when the time is right.
# text = Another alternative is to give Murphy barrels at their 95,000 bpd Meraux, Louisiana refinery in exchange for the new production barrels.
# text = Could someone in your group please give me a notional non binding basis differential for this quality of crude for Cal 2003?
# text = please print
# text = 01/24/2001 01:02 PM
# text = Please address, and I'll check with Legal as well.
# text = We typically only book deals when everything is signed off.
# text = Jeff
# text = David Hoog
# text = 01/26/2001 09:37 AM
# text = following up on our discussion yesterday; for these types of deals, i dont think its necessary to have all the documentation of our counterparty's authorization to enter into the agreement.
# text = these are short term transactions and requiring this documentation will cause us to lose business because competitive alternatives do not have such burdensome requirements.
# text = the primary reason we need these things is for the scenario where a muni does a derivative deal with an open-ended downside, loses $50 million, and then claims that it was not a valid contract.
# text = in our case, they are only hedging.
# text = we are collecting a premium up front and their total cost is known up front.
# text = therefore they will not attempt to make this claim.
# text = even if they did, our risk is limited to the premium , not some big payout.
# text = the risk of losing business is far greater than the risk of a counterparty trying to get their premium back.
# text = seems like a 5 second decision to me.
# text = is it possible to combine the standard isda and our confirm into a single long form?
# text = by going away from the standard isda maybe we can eliminate these requirements because the payout liability is only 1-way.
# text = please print

# text = Dear Mr. Shankman,
# text = Thank you very much for your quick reply.
# text = Attached is my resume.
# text = I highlight the relevant skills in the summary.
# text = The position is with the EES MMC EAST department / WHOLESALE, RETAIL & COMM, ENRON ENERGY SERVICES.
# text = It was posted on Dec. 11, but the Human Resource dept said that if it is still on the internet, it is open.
# text = Look forward to hearing your comments / suggestions.
# text = Regards,
# text = Rina
# text = - ENRONR~1.DOC
# text = Yikes!
# text = That girl's mother sounds like a real problem.
# text = I'm not sure how I would have handled it.
# text = How's school going?
# text = Any plans for the weekend?
# text = 01/26/2001 11:36 AM
# text = What happened?
# text = Here's a story...as I was waiting at the bus stop (7:35am) to go to school, a lady approached me and asked if I'd make sure her daughter got on a certain bus.
# text = The mother was running late for work and could not wait.
# text = I couldn't say no...so Nicki (the little girl-10 yrs. old) and I waited for the bus.
# text = It was now, 8:15 and there was no sign of her bus.
# text = On top of things, I had quiz at 8am.
# text = Which I then realized I missed.
# text = I decided that Nicki would just have to wait on her own.
# text = I asked her if she had any relatives that would want to know of her whereabouts.
# text = I called her grandmother and explained things to her.
# text = Pretty strange...aye.
# text = A bus that runs through UofH arrived and I almost got on without her, but I couldn't do it.
# text = Finally, I told the little girl that she would have to accompany me to school (8:30am).
# text = There were only 15 minutes left of class.
# text = I stayed for the remainder of the lecture.
# text = After class we went back to bus stop and within minutes her bus arrived.
# text = I told the bus driver where to drop her off.
# text = I notified her grandmother with the time of the departure.
# text = And I was relieved when Nicki called to let me know she was home safe.
# text = Please send the memo to the EGM business heads as well.
# text = Thanks.
# text = Jeff
# text = Jana Giovannini
# text = 01/26/2001 10:51 AM
# text = Actually, Jen has volunteered for the afternoon session.
# text = I spoke to her prior to my note.
# text = Is there anyone else in EGM that could participate?
# text = Please let me know.
# text = Thanks.
# text = Jen, please take care of this for EGM
# text = Jana Giovannini
# text = 01/24/2001 11:42 AM
# text = All,
# text = The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that need to be addressed immediately.
# text = While we anticipate many new Analysts joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting event.
# text = We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.
# text = I am asking that you forward this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).
# text = We will conduct first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the afternoon.
# text = We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning (9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.
# text = Please submit your response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.
# text = In addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.
# text = Thanks in advance for your cooperation.
# text = Thank you,
# text = Jana
# text = Where does our 50% (the 1.65 million dollars) show up?
# text = Can you provide me with more details?
# text = Great job, guys.
# text = Eric Gonzales
# text = 01/25/2001 02:02 AM
# text = Great job gentlemen!
# text = This deviation shows that Eco definitely has a significant amount of option value which can be exploited with quick reactions and favourable market movements.
# text = Eric
# text = 25/01/2001 00:20
# text = Finally completed tonight
# text = Net to Enron LNG Marketing Company - $ 272,000 ( $0.10/ mmbtu )
# text = Net to Eco about $3,300,000 ( Enron 50% share about $ 1,650,000 )
# text = Enron total gain not counting ENA's trading desk margin is $1,922,000
# text = Not bad for a single cargo.
# text = Wayne
# text = Jen, please take care of this for EGM
# text = Marianne: The following are my comments:
# text = 1. In Section 1.1, there should be a parentheses after etc. in the 5th line.
# text = 2. In Section 3.1, in the last sentence after the proviso insert "a" before the word "change" and after the word "in".
# text = 3. In Section 6.1, change 20 Business Days to 20 days.
# text = Also, add a semicolon at the end of clause (i).
# text = 4. In Section 6.2.1 I'll just note that the discount rate sentence I think is still an open issue.
# text = 5. In Section 6.3, clause (c) should be reworded to fit with the language in the beginning of the Section.
# text = 6. Capitalize the word "facility" in the definition of Average Annual Load Factor.
# text = 7. Delete the definition of Costs as it is already defined in Section 6.2.1.
# text = 8. Where is the defined term Govt Authority used?
# text = 9. In the GTC, the ECP rep should also apply to EESI.
# text = Also, in the 7th line of the reps add the word "into" after the word "entered" and before the word "this".
# text = 10. In Collateral Requests, insert a comma after deposit in the last line.
# text = I will also add granting/perfection language.
# text = 11. In Events of Default, clause (a) refers to a dispute section which I'm not sure exists.
# text = In clause (e), delete the "s": from the word consolidation.
# text = 12. Remedies should be deleted as it is already covered in Section 6.1.
# text = 13. In UCC/Disclaimer of warranties, add a clause (c).
# text = I would add setoff language.

# text = 05/30/2001 11:05 AM
# text = Carol:
# text = I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short form.
# text = Attached please find a sample short form (for the Con Ed market) for your review.
# text = Please note the following as you review:
# text = 1. The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of our midmarket forms anticipate that we will act as customer's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to T&D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and pass those amounts on to the customer's utility.
# text = 2. I did not include a "Setoff" provision in this draft, mainly because the vast majority of the time, we will not, nor will an affiliate, have another agreement in place with these customers.
# text = If you feel strongly about our including a setoff provision, we will do so.
# text = 3. The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh (and we've had great difficulty selling it in the past).
# text = Taking into consideration this class of customer, we decided to include certain items, including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or practices as a "force majeure event" in an effort to soften the approach (see the GTCs).
# text = Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again, more in the interest of "saving space" than anything else...
# text = Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched.
# text = If you are comfortable, we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms.
# text = Thanks again for your help with this project,
# text = Marianne
# text = P.S. Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your response -- they will be taking this project during my "hiatus" -- I am moving to PA on Friday of this week, and will be out of pocket through approximately 7/16.
# text = I will start up again in mid-July...
# text = John:
# text = I have faxed to you the form of Bond, our proposed Bond provisions and the EEI Master.
# text = I am waiting on the confirms and will send them to you shortly by fax or e-mail.

# text = I think Valerie Mooney (our credit person) and Ed Sacks are still discussing some minor fine tuning of the LOC format.
# text = I spoke to Bob Bruce this morning - we're all set on the language in the Schedule to the ISDA, and there is a minor credit/billing issue in Paragraph 13 related to the timing of transfer of interest on collateral that Val will discuss with Ed as well.
# text = As far as the EEI goes, the only remaining issue that I'm aware of (aside from finalizing the LOC) is whether we've finished coordinating the Attachment containing the list of prior transactions.
# text = Sounds like we may actually get these documents executed early next week.

# text = I wanted you all to have a look at what we believe is the final draft.
# text = It is a fairly standard, fully reimbursable interconnect with Questar.
# text = Transwestern will own and operate the interconnect.

# text = If anyone has any questions or concerns about the timing of these payments, please give me a call.
# text = Also, you will notice this interconnect may not be subject to the CIAC tax gross up, but to protect ourselves, we have added language in Para 3.2 that protects us financially if the IRS ever comes back to determine that this interconnect is subject to the CIAC tax.
# text = Robert Guthrie with the tax department has worked with us to develop this language.

# text = No hurry, I was just wondering.
# text = Thanks,

# text = Attached is the TW Top Ten Shippers by Revenues for the year 2001 to be reported in the Browncover report.
# text = Note:
# text = Total transportation invoiced for 2001 was $180.9m.
# text = The amount of transportation revenues recorded in the general ledger is $165.9m.
# text = This difference is mainly due to the following:
# text = $10.0m - negotiated rates reserve(Reliant,Sempra, Richardson, Astr,and BP Energy) - $collected
# text = $ 2.7m - SoCal rate issue - $not collected
# text = $ 1.8m - additional month of PGE revenues due to prepayment invoicing beginning in 2001 - $collected
# text = Revenues for these customers were adjusted according.
# text = Also, revenues for the shippers acquiring released volumes from PGE at rates above TW's tariff rates were adjusted accordingly.
# text = Please call me at x36709 if there are questions

# text = Kim,
# text = Here is the Job Description and the Operational Accountabilities for the position I mentioned to you last Sunday.
# text = As you can see it will take someone with some very good skills in organizing and interpersonal relationships.
# text = It will also require someone who is fairly mature in their own spiritual journey.
# text = If you know someone who might fit the bill ask them to contact me and/or send me their resume.

# text = Mansoor,
# text = Let's discuss.
# text = Kim.
# text = Kim
# text = The in-service date of May 1, will be very difficult to attain.
# text = Since the bankruptcy filing, vendors have been very reluctant to ship material prior to it being prepaid (Daniels, Fisher, Rosemont, other).
# text = These are the vendors of instrumentation required for the interconnect.
# text = Questar may be able to purchase material, but some of the items can have up to a 60 day delivery.
# text = (From time PA approved and funded to in-service will be 75 days at most.
# text = We have worked with Daniels on a chromatograph on another project and prepayment has taken 45 days alone.
# text = Daniels is not set up for prepayments as they bill off an invoice and the main office and accounting had to create an invoice for a chromatograph that had not been delivered.
# text = Not the usual mode of operations.
# text = The I/C design is for a UltraSonic meter and this is dependent on their testing schedule ( Canada or Kansas are the only two places to test to 100% of design).
# text = Will confirm testing schedule and delivery dates with UltraSonic ASAP.
# text = We will try to complete the I/C with the earliest in-service date possible, but with conditions as they are, a realistic date would be June 15, 2002.
# text = If you have questions or issues, please let me know.
# text = Thanks
# text = Earl Chanley 505-625-8031
# text = Earl,
# text = We are looking at putting the metering facilities on their ROW (also, I think we will have to purchase about 50ft of ROW from ElPaso to get to Questar's property).
# text = As you look at this, if for some reason we cannot obtain ElPaso ROW, we will have to look at Plan B which would be to put the metering on our ROW.
# text = Our in-service date is May 1.
# text = If you think that May 1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts/materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent Enron events, please let me know.
# text = Questar has already informed us that they would help obtain parts/materials to our specifications if it helps achieve an in-service date of May 1.
# text = Thanks,
# text = Kim.
# text = Listening to the Edison call w/investors Edison says they will pay everyone at the same time ("big bang" approach) sometime in Q1'02.
# text = My concern is that between now and then Dunn, the AG have the time and resources to make a heckuvalot of mischief, which could be detrimental to generators/marketers' claims.
# text = Investors are asking what Edison intends for QFs and generators--asking about haircuts in particular--and Edison is side-stepping the questions.
# text = Great.
# text = Figured they'd contacted them, but wanted to make sure.
# text = You know when the meeting with schedulers will be?
# text = I apologize, I'm on the road and haven't heard when that will be.
# text = I'm thinking that I may want to attend.
# text = Thanks.
# text = Best,
# text = Jeff
# text = Thanks for the info - a few people from our shop will be in attendance./
# text = If you haven't heard, SoCal's announced their abandoning windows for OFOs.
# text = They're holding "workshops" on how it will all work soon.
# text = I'll get you the announcement.

# text = Probing the 'palace coup'
# text = Electricity: A panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president.
# text = September 26, 2001
# text = By KIMBERLY KINDY
# text = The Orange County Register
# text = SACRAMENTO
# text = A state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices.
# text = The investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: "the palace coup."
# text = Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers.
# text = The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge.
# text = Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show.
# text = "I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort," said Dunn.
# text = The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos.
# text = Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "betrayed" by the actions of Winter.
# text = "The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis," Maviglio said.
# text = Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office.
# text = ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct.
# text = The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on.
# text = At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps.
# text = "It was an emergency," Fishman said.
# text = "We had to take action.''
# text = What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power.
# text = The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier.
# text = "They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much," said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March.
# text = "All hell broke loose.''
# text = Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed.
# text = The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators.
# text = "If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III.
# text = Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials.
# text = He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "fix" prices, which would violate federal trade laws.
# text = In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market.
# text = The generators got their way.
# text = The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan.
# text = What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier.
# text = Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints.
# text = They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted.
# text = What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis.
# text = Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap.
# text = Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government.
# text = Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed.
# text = In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made.
# text = He didn't mention anything about it.
# text = "In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said.
# text = With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs.
# text = "The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said.
# text = "It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant.
# text = This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business."
# text = Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show.
# text = Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion.
# text = Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians.
# text = Prices, he said, did not spike as a result.
# text = Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity.
# text = Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials.
# text = "We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said.
# text = "In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation.
# text = We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund."
# text = Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap.
# text = Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted.
# text = "Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers.
# text = "He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing."
# text = The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions.
# text = Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said.
# text = James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter.
# text = "They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said.
# text = "They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do."
# text = What Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired.
# text = He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues.
# text = "We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out," Dunn said.
# text = "Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''
# text = We should resurrect Mike Smith's note and get him on the call in the attempt to avoid recreating the wheel on this one.
# text = I can dig it up if you'd like.
# text = Sue and Jeff --
# text = I am having a meeting with Vicki and Janet Dietrich on Thursday to discuss our view on the ability to extend our current contracts in CA (for customers already on DA).
# text = Can we discuss this today or soon thereafter.
# text = My take is that the UDCs will be indifferent to this (maybe?) and our #1 priority is to work to get the PG&E model adopted across the state.
# text = Any news on how SCE and SDG&E will move forward?
# text = Thanks.
# text = Sounds good.
# text = I suggest a "blind draw" on the teams, best ball not scramble on the golf, and as for the wager, no emails from the losing team for one week!
# text = Is there any question?
# text = I'll leave to Steve to structure the deal.
# text = As I recall, Montavano, Shapiro and I usually make up one team, but I'm willing to switch around a bit.
# text = Best,
# text = Jeff
# text = Are you playing golf?

# text = 11/28/2000 06:16 PM
# text = It's a two way street, of course.
# text = Have they expressed any interest in negotiating?
# text = There is nothing wrong with a REAL negotiation, but nothing particularly helpful about generating one that s just for show.
# text = Particularly in the absence of any entreaty from them.
# text = Where is the "simple" explanation of the transportation piece?
# text = As I have told RNR, I think we should advise Duke in writing that its IP is not in conformity with the contract, sinceit is in the alternative, and that our IP is hence the only one that will be before the arbitrators (since Duke clearly cannot change it's ineffective IP at this stage, having already seen ours).
# text = Accordingly, the only issue left for arbitration is whether our IP (the only one and therefore the one they have to choose) is or is not an economic hardship under the contract.
# text = What say ye?
# text = none

# text = Richard do you have any bad faith litigation pending against any insurers in Texas or are you aware of any Enron has filed??

# text = It settled anyway, a long time ago.

# text = (b) Is it right that Enron has 3 sets of bad faith proceedings in Texas?
# text = (c) Are you happy with the draft letter to Beachcrofts I sent you?
# text = Please give me a call if you would like to discuss.
# text = Justin
# text = Not when I was there, but I wasn't there the whole time.
# text = Michelle and Ken,
# text = were you able to discuss the "bad faith" proceedings issue yesterday?
# text = If you got the chance today, I should be really grateful if one of you could give me a call to discuss this issue; I think we should set out DPC's position clearly on this in correspondence without too much delay.

# text = Marriage is, in and of itself, a noble concept, but it too often leads to kids and kids flat out suck.

# text = These are the kids who will destroy society, because of the crapfest the American family has become under the post hippie culture, you heard again.
# text = And you might think by reading this I blame the kids.....
# text = Not so, Kids are what kids are and will do what they do.
# text = It is literally monkey see and monkey do with them.
# text = That will likely never change.
# text = It's the bad parents out there who fuck up their lives and dont seem to understand that once you decide to have kids, it is indeed time to grow up and be a responsible role model for those kids.
# text = Very few parents do this.
# text = And this is a direct result of the Politically correct, permissive, time out granting bullshit liberal culture that has caused this.
# text = People like this will never have my sympathy, nor do they deserve my sympathy.

# text = It looks like NASA is ready to sour again after it's devastating loss from the Columbia accident which occurred nearly two years ago.
# text = Now, NASA engineers and astronauts are almost giddy with "go" fever as the tentative date for the first launch since the Columbia disaster approaches.
# text = The most important question isn't whether Discovery is technically ready to fly with new safety features and emergency procedures, but whether the agency itself has learned from the crucial errors most common to Challenger and Columbia, errors that grew out of a management culture that discouraged criticism and sacrificed safety for image-puffing and budget-cutting.
# text = I hope so.
# text = Seeing another "Columbia" incident can be quite frightening (I woke up to it early in the morning when I was in Texas).
# text = We don't need another incident as exploring the cosmos is something that keeps our imagination going as a species.
# text = Maybe one day they will allow space tourism, (hopefully that will be in the near future)although I would recommend that NASA build new shuttles instead of trying to preserve the older ones.
# text = You do have to give NASA credit on some things as they have eliminated the "fear of reporting failure" culture that probably led to the lack of reporting defects on the Columbia shuttle.
# text = Instead they are encouraging everyone to come forward if they see any potential problems (as it is clear that overlooked problems could result in unnecessary losses).
# text = But supporters are pointing a few good things out:
# text = Clearly, the agency has worked hard at tackling the technical challenges posed by a superb and surprisingly independent-minded investigative panel.
# text = A few weeks ago, shuttle workers at the Kennedy Space Center received a rocket-like boost in morale with two important deliveries for the next shuttle to carry.

# text = Healing the Collective Body
# text = In George Orwell's influential novel "1984" doublethink is a device promoted by the totalitarian state government to make people accept two irreconcilable ideas at the same time such as "war is peace".
# text = I see the merit in flowing with duality.
# text = One of my most cherished dualities is the understanding that we are both autonomous individuals with the power to shape our personal destinies and at the same time we are all one, that there is no separation between you and I, we are all together in this thing called life, we human beings, the birds and the tress, the rocks and the sky, all of it.
# text = I have written a lot recently about healing the self so today here are a few words on healing our collective body, mind and soul.
# text = Think of all life, if you will, as one great choir or one grand congregation.
# text = Our strength is in our unity and harmony.
# text = Any major dischord and we all suffer.
# text = Any insult to the collective good brings us all down.
# text = Living out of synch with nature is the great disease, from that flows all the tributaries we have come to think of as sickness.
# text = We are only as strong as our weakest, we are only as healthy as the sickest amongst us- playing sports and being in the army taught me that lesson before I was finished being a teenager.
# text = When the healthy treat the sick with scorn and intolerance it brings us all down.
# text = When those lucky enough not to have Herpes create a climate of shame and indignity for those of us who do, not only are they hurting us, but they are hurting themselves.
# text = There is no escape from the collective ocean we all swim in.
# text = What you project will always come back to either reward or haunt you.
# text = We are now suffering from the consequences of our rape of the environment, our rejection of the natural for the industrial, and our embrace of violence over peace.
# text = Jesus said that what you do the least of the people you do to him.
# text = What are you doing to the least of the people?
# text = If we are all in this thing together, let's play nice.
# text = Remember that what you do to yourself affects me and everybody else, remember that what you do to me and anyone else shapes your destiny.
# text = No matter what progress we make as individuals in becoming healthier, we will never achieve real health until we collectively decide to create a healthier reality.
# text = Fortunately circumstances will force our hand soon since our collective bad behaviour cannot continue indefinitely.
# text = In the near future collective choices will need to be made.
# text = Will we choose to live in harmony with this planet or crash and burn in a conflagration of arrogance and disregard?
# text = Will we choose to rise about prejudice and intolerance or go down kicking and screaming with holding on to fear and anger?
# text = There is no health without peace and no peace without health.

# text = It is our belief that this compensation plan will produce some of the largest checks in network marketing history.
# text = The plan can't be described as a binary, a breakaway, a unilevel, or a forced matrix.
# text = It is a revolutionary hybrid.
# text = What is long term viability?
# text = It is not just company longevity.
# text = If you used to make $100k and now only make $30k, this is not long term viability.
# text = Ten years later your check should still be the same or greater, fulfilling the promise of long-term residual income.
# text = The Agel compensation plan includes the principles that ensure that promise can be fulfilled for those who work at it.

# text = Quebecker wins U.S. bravery award
# text = Pittsburgh -
# text = A Quebec man was awarded a Carnegie Medal for bravery on Monday for saving two friends by fighting off a polar bear with a pocket knife two years ago on Baffin Island
# text = Dr. Eric Fortier, 34, of Gatineau, Que., used a pocket knife to attack a polar bear on Baffin Island, just south of the Arctic Circle, to save two friends who were being mauled.
# text = "All of the research and all of the preparation I did leading up to the trip gave no indication that there were bears in the Soper [River] valley where we were canoeing," Dr. Fortier said.
# text = Dr. Fortier, an orthodontist, learned there was at least one polar bear in the central region of Baffin Island in July 2001 when he felt what he thought was a dog leaning on his tent wall.
# text = "My first thought was to push it away," he said.
# text = "A few seconds later my girlfriend saw the shadow of a bear's paw through the tent fly and then it started ripping through the ceiling."
# text = The polar bear is more dangerous than most other bears.
# text = The latter usually consider human beings a threat but the polar bear considers humans a snack, experts said.
# text = The two screamed to frighten the bear and warn their friends in a tent several metres away but the bear ripped into that tent and began mauling 31-year-old Alain Parenteau.
# text = "Their screams changed," Dr. Fortier said.
# text = "I grabbed my glasses and my knife and unzipped my tent and headed out."
# text = The bear dwarfed the 6-foot-1 Mr. Parenteau, knocking him to the ground, he said.
# text = Dr. Fortier threw a large rock at the bear, distracting it and allowing Parenteau to escape but it then turned on 25-year-old Patricia Doyon, who was in the same tent.
# text = Again Dr. Fortier threw rocks at the bear and again its target was able to escape.
# text = "The bear gave chase and I gave chase," he said.
# text = "At some point, Patricia tripped or the bear tripped her and was at her back.
# text = I was beside the bear's head and I stabbed it with an upper cut below the jaw in the neck a couple of times."
# text = The bear ran off.
# text = While there was some fur and blood on the nine-centimetre blade, Dr. Fortier said he doesn't think he hurt the bear badly.
# text = Both Mr. Parenteau and Ms. Doyon, however, were bleeding badly.
# text = Dr. Fortier and his girlfriend lashed two canoes together and paddled eight kilometres along the Soper River.
# text = Dr. Fortier travelled another three kilometres by foot to seek help in the nearest settlement.
# text = Both Mr. Parenteau and Ms. Doyon were airlifted to a hospital and survived, though Mr. Parenteau had a gash within a centimetre of his jugular, Dr. Fortier said.
# text = Dr. Fortier was one of 15 people to receive the Carnegie Medal on Monday.
# text = The bronze medal is given to people who "risk their lives to an extraordinary degree while saving or attempting to save the lives of others."

# text = Hi all,
# text = There are already several forums around the net focused on discussing Guild Wars, so why create a new one?
# text = I say why not?
# text = The main reason is Google is more accessible to the global community and you can rest assured that it's not going to go away.
# text = I have seen great fan sites suddenly disappear without notice and for no reason.
# text = Usually this happens because the developer of the site can no longer afford the cost of bandwidth being used.
# text = That said, the maintenance of this forum is handled by Google and thus will remain reliable and it will ultimately give us more time to play :).
# text = I'm nothing more than a devoted fan of the game myself and I hope that this area can become a haven for deep fan discussions.
# text = Regards,
# text = Humanpixel

# text = FROM: GEORGE WALKER BUSH 202.456.1414 / 202.456.1111 FAX: 202.456.2461
# text = Dear Sir / Madam,
# text = I am GEORGE WALKER BUSH, son of the former president of the United States of America George Herbert Walker Bush, and currently serving as President of the United States of America.
# text = This letter might surprise you because we have not met neither in person nor by correspondence.
# text = I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to an account requiring maximum confidence.
# text = I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance in acquiring oil funds that are presently trapped in the republic of Iraq.
# text = My partners and I solicit your assistance in completing a transaction begun by my father, who has long been actively engaged in the extraction of petroleum in the United States of America, and bravely served his country as director of the United States Central Intelligence Agency.
# text = In the decade of the nineteen-eighties, my father, then vice-president of the United States of America, sought to work with the good offices of the President of the Republic of Iraq to regain lost oil revenue sources in the neighboring Islamic republic of Iran.
# text = This unsuccessful venture was soon followed by a falling-out with his Iraqi partner, who sought to acquire additional oil revenue sources in the neighboring emirate of Kuwait, a wholly-owned U.S.-British subsidiary.
# text = My father re-secured the petroleum assets of Kuwait in 1991 at a cost of sixty-one billion U.S. dollars ($61,000,000,000).
# text = But my father's former Iraqi business partner remained in control of the republic of Iraq and its petroleum reserves.
# text = My family is calling for your urgent assistance in funding the removal of the President of the Republic of Iraq and acquiring the petroleum assets of his country, as compensation for the costs of removing him from power.
# text = Unfortunately, our partners from 1991 are not willing to shoulder the burden of this new venture, which in its upcoming phase may cost the sum of 100 billion to 200 billion dollars ($100,000,000,000 - $200,000,000,000), both in the initial acquisition and in long-term management.
# text = Without the funds from our 1991 partners, we would not be able to acquire the oil revenue trapped within Iraq.
# text = That is why my family and our colleagues are urgently seeking your gracious assistance.
# text = Our distinguished colleagues in this business transaction include the sitting vice-president of the United States of America, Richard Cheney, who is an original partner in the Iraq venture and former head of the Halliburton oil company, and Condoleeza Rice, whose professional dedication to the venture was demonstrated in the naming of a Chevron oil tanker after her.
# text = I would beseech you to transfer a sum equaling ten to twenty-five percent(10-25 %) of your yearly income to our account to aid in this important venture.
# text = The Internal Revenue Service of the United States of America will function as our trusted intermediary.
# text = I propose that you make this transfer before the fifteenth (15th) of the month of April.
# text = I know that a transaction of this magnitude would make anyone apprehensive and worried.
# text = But I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.
# text = A bold step taken shall not be regretted, I assure you.
# text = Please do be informed that this business transaction is 100% legal.
# text = If you do not wish to co-operate in this transaction, please contact our intermediary representatives to further discuss the matter.
# text = I pray that you understand our plight.
# text = My family and our colleagues will be forever grateful.
# text = Please reply in strict confidence to the contact numbers below.
# text = Sincerely with warm regards,

# text = Hello yheggy-ga,
# text = On September 21, 2004, the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee approved $16.379 billion in funding for NASA for fiscal year 2005.
# text = This is a $200 million increase over what NASA received for fiscal year 2004.
# text = U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations
# text = Press Release
# text = September 21, 2004
# text = "National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA): is funded at $16.379 billion, an increase of $200 million over the FY04 enacted level, and a reduction of $665 million from the budget request.
# text = An additional $800 million in emergency funding was added for NASA during the Committee's consideration of the bill.
# text = -- The return to flight activities for the Shuttle program are funded at $4.319 billion, the requested level from the Administration.
# text = -- The International Space Station is funded at $1.6 billion.
# text = The bill reduces ISS operations by $120 million due to the continued reduced capability of the ISS for at least half of FY05.
# text = -- The Moon/Mars vision:
# text = --- The Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) is funded at $268 million.
# text = --- A lunar exploration mission is funded at $20 million.
# text = --- $10 million is provided for Centennial Challenges.
# text = Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (NRC): is funded at $115 million, the same as FY04 and the budget request."
# text = Spacetoday.net
# text = Senate increases NASA funding
# text = "The Senate Appropriations Committee used a somewhat controversial technique Tuesday to increase NASA's fiscal year 2005 budget by $200 million over what President Bush requested.

# text = Excellent answer googlenut.
# text = Let me add some additional info.
# text = You can get details about NASA spending here, from their own webpage.
# text = Also, from their own webpage, reasons why NASA is important, in a 5th grade format.
# text = I guess if you are someone not familiar with how NASA benefits our society I can see how one might form the opinion of yheggy-ga.
# text = Let me put it this way - If you have watched TV recently, crossed a modern bridge, flown in an airplane, recieved any form of modern medicine, did any mathematics, drove a car, used a cellular phone, etc. then you have somehow directly reaped the rewards which NASA has returned to us.
# text = Also NASA has a large outreach program for education, some people believe this is important.
# text = Best, Steve.
# text = Subject: Re: NASA IS A WASTE! From: jaqamofino-ga on 26 Apr 2005 06:02 PDT
# text = i believe that NASA is a HUGE waste of tax payers' money, but there are so many huge wastes of tax payer monies, that i find it best not to think about it.
# text = i also think the National Endowment for the Arts is a waste, but i guess i would rather see my money go to the NEA than NASA.
# text = of course, in a perfect world, tax payers' money would go toward some sort of national healthcare program, and housing for the homeless, but this is far from a perfect world.
# text = in response to Steve's comment: do you really believe that spending trillions on space exploration over the years was the ONLY way to invent the cellfone?

# text = (Filed: 19/11/2004)
# text = China's insatiable demand for energy is prompting fears of financial and diplomatic collisions around the globe as it seeks reliable supplies of oil from as far away as Brazil and Sudan.
# text = An intrusion into Japanese territorial waters by a Chinese nuclear submarine last week and a trade deal with Brazil are the latest apparently unconnected consequences of China's soaring economic growth.
# text = Increased car usage in China is creating a high demand for petrol
# text = The connection, however, lies in an order issued last year by President Hu Jintao to seek secure oil supplies abroad - preferably ones which could not be stopped by America in case of conflict over Taiwan.
# text = The submarine incident was put down to a "technical error" by the Chinese government, which apologised to Japan.
# text = But even before the incident the People's Daily, the government mouthpiece, had commented that competition over the East China Sea between the two countries was "only a prelude of the game between China and Japan in the arena of international energy".
# text = The Brazil trade deal included funding for a joint oil-drilling and pipeline programme at a cost that experts said would add up to three times the cost of simply buying oil on the market.
# text = The West, however, has paid little attention to these developments.
# text = For the United States and Europe are far more concerned with the even more sensitive issues of China's relations with "pariah states".
# text = In September, China threatened to veto any move to impose sanctions on Sudan over the atrocities in Darfur.
# text = It has invested $3 billion in the African country's oil industry, which supplies it with seven per cent of its needs.
# text = Then, this month, it said that it opposed moves to refer Iran's nuclear stand-off with the International Atomic Energy Agency to the United Nations Security Council.
# text = A week before, China's second biggest state oil firm had signed a $70 billion deal for oilfield and natural gas development with Iran, which already supplies 13 per cent of China's needs.
# text = China has its own reserves of oil and natural gas and once was a net oil exporter.
# text = But as its economy has expanded by an average of nine per cent per year for the last two decades, so has its demand for energy.
# text = This year it overtook Japan as the world's second largest consumer of energy, behind the US.
# text = Its projected demand, boosted by a huge rise in car ownership as well as the need to find alternatives to polluting coal for electricity generation, has contributed to the surge in the price of oil this year.
# text = Shortages are already leading to power cuts in the big cities.
# text = Since President Hu ordered state-owned oil firms to "go abroad" to ensure supply, they have begun drilling for gas in the East China Sea, just west of the line that Japan regards as its border.
# text = Japan protested, to no avail, that the project should be a joint one.
# text = The two are also set to clash over Russia's oil wealth.
# text = China is furious that Japan has outbid it in their battle to determine the route of the pipeline that Russia intends to build to the Far East.
# text = Japan favoured a route to the sea, enabling oil to be shipped to both Japan and China.
# text = China wanted an overland route through its own territory, which would give it ultimate control if hostilities broke out.
# text = Increasingly, analysts are saying that China's efforts have gone beyond what is safe or even in its own interests.
# text = Claude Mandil, the executive director of the International Energy Agency in Paris, said the reserves in the East China Sea were hardly worth the trouble.
# text = "Nobody thinks that there will be a lot of oil and gas in this part of the world," he said.
# text = "It may be a difficult political issue but I don't think the energy content is worthwhile."
# text = Eurasia Group, a New York-based firm of political analysts, said its oil experts worked out that China was paying such an inflated price for its investment in Brazil that the cost for the oil it ended up with was three times the market price.
# text = "If China's economy falters, which, in my view, appears increasingly likely, then commodity prices will plummet, and with them, the value of the assets that produce them," Jason Kindopp, Eurasia's lead China analyst, said.
# text = "Beijing may end up in a early 1990s Japan situation, where it is forced to sell recently purchased overseas assets for a fraction of what it paid for them."
# text = China's wider aggression to secure oil and gas was the greatest threat to its international standing in the next decade.
# text = "Sudan is the primary example," he said.
# text = "It marks the first time in recent years that China has promised to wield its veto power in the UN Security Council against a petition initiated by the United States and backed by France and Great Britain."

# text = Visualizations as a helpful beginning technique
# text = -----------------------------------------------
# text = If you consider that you still need the assistance of other visualizations to help the mind feel the spirit of transcendence, try the following before moving onto the more formal method below.
# text = Visualisations can be as useful tools, but meditation is more than that.
# text = Meditation has to do with what is called ideation.
# text = It is always good to stick to a formal intense meditation practice like the one for beginners described in the MP3 file that follows after the visualisations.
# text = Find a comfortable place on the floor and sit with your legs crossed.
# text = Your breathing should be calm and relaxed, through the nose.
# text = Spend a minute or so concentrating on your breath, feeling the air flowing through your nostrils.
# text = 1. Warm Sun Visualization
# text = Continue to breathe slowly and deeply.
# text = With each breath, feel the muscles in your body becoming lighter and lighter, and also your external motor and sensory organs are feeling like they are withdrawing from the world into a special inner quietness.
# text = Imagine the tension melting away as you continue breathing rhythmically and naturally.
# text = Picture yourself sitting on a warm, tropical beach basking in the glow of the sun ... .
# text = Visualize the vivid, beautiful colours of the earth (its flowers and plants), the sea next to you, and the sky above you.
# text = Feel yourself floating above the earth and sea.
# text = As you sit above the world, the warmth of the golden sun penetrates your body and makes you feel warmer and warmer.
# text = It surrounds you.
# text = The golden rays feel soft and soothing.
# text = Now you are far above the earth - into space.
# text = Everything around you is so vast.
# text = Yet, there is warmth and a familiarity with the vastness.
# text = You want to merge your mind with the greater universal Mind that surrounds you.
# text = And while doing so continue using the Baba Nam Kevalam mantra (breathe in with Baba Nam, breathe out with Kevalam).
# text = Try this for 5 to 10 minutes.
# text = Now come back to earth again - slowly.
# text = Imagine yourself sitting on the beach serenely and restfully.
# text = Your muscles are loose and limp.
# text = Feel your body sinking slightly into the sand making that earthly connection again.
# text = The sun's rays and warmth are still with you, surrounding you.
# text = You are in a state of peace and relaxation.
# text = With each breath, watch your body and ensure that it remains relaxed - at peace.
# text = Continue to feel the warmth of the sunlight all over your body, warming you deeply and gently.
# text = You want to bring something back with you from your deep space experience where you sensed your mind merging with the universal Mind.
# text = This will be the warmth of the sun - a close reminder and link between earth and the infinite space.
# text = Visualize the inside of your body bathed in the golden light, absorbing every ray and glowing as radiantly as the sun.
# text = A warm, gentle breeze swirls around your body and relaxes you even more .
# text = Let your mind and body be totally at peace.
# text = Now feel yourself returning to where you sit ... move your hands and feet a little, stretch them.
# text = Open your eyes.
# text = 2. Mountain Visualization
# text = Another thing you can try.
# text = Imagine you're sitting on top of a mountain, and that it's the most peaceful place you can think of.
# text = Feel that you're sitting there in complete peace, right on top of the world.
# text = Now imagine that infinite happiness is surrounding you in every direction.
# text = Feel you're completely surrounded by that infinite peace and happiness.
# text = Now start to repeat within your mind the mantra: BABA NAM KEVALAM.
# text = Its meaning is "Infinite happiness is everywhere".
# text = Feel the meaning, don't just think of its wordy meaning or try to translate from Sanskrit (BABA NAM KEVALAM) to an English meaning (Infinite peace and happiness).
# text = Think internally, intuitively, not by words, of the meaning, as you're repeating it.
# text = This is called ideation.
# text = It is important to take the idea, not just the intellectual analysis.
# text = Touching deep into the idea is what builds intuition - it is a synthetic process.
# text = Whereas, trying to translate and grapple with wordy meanings is an intellectual mechanism - an analytical process.
# text = Feel you're surrounded by infinite peace and happiness, and feel that your own sense of existence is in direct contact with that endless peace and happiness all around you.
# text = You can go further and feel that your unit consciousness, a dot in the Infinite Consciousness, is merging with Infinity.
# text = Continue for as long as you like, then open your eyes.
# text = OK that is fairly basic :).
# text = The important point is to develop some psycho-spiritual connection between your mind and the universal Consciousness or Supreme Consciousness.
# text = Don't worry if you have trouble concentrating on the mantra and ideation - that's normal.
# text = It takes some time and practice to be able to focus on the one thought.
# text = The main thing is to keep practicing.
# text = If you don't practice, then nothing happens.
# text = Well maybe a miracle could happen, but lets face it we're ordinary people and so require practical day to day techniques!

# text = NORTH CAROLINA RELIGIOUS COALITION FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY
# text = From what we hear from the news media, one could easily conclude that all Christians are opposed to gay marriage.
# text = But that’s not the case.
# text = Last year an organization named the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality was formed to get out the message that at least some people of faith are not opposed to extending the rights and responsibilities of civil marriage to same-gender couples.
# text = One of “NCRC4ME’s” major efforts is to collect signatures for the attached “Declaration of Religious Leaders,” which has been and will again be presented to members of the NC legislature.
# text = It presents the case for marriage equality and states, “We are resolved that the State should not interfere with same-gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights, responsibilities, and commitments of civil marriage.”
# text = A measure to amend the NC Constitution to ban gay marriage was defeated last year but already has been reintroduced in the 2005 legislative session, so there is a real need for visible support for the “pro-same-gender-marriage” side of this issue.
# text = At its February meeting the CHS Vestry voted unanimously to add their names to the Declaration.
# text = Our Rector Barbara and our Deacon Clare also have signed the Declaration.
# text = Furthermore, the Vestry voted unanimously to invite the support of members of the CHS congregation for the Declaration.
# text = (Since the Declaration is written as coming from “religious leaders,” people who don’t consider themselves “religious leaders” can sign as “Supporters of the North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality.”)
# text = Please note that the Declaration addresses only civil marriage; it says nothing about religious beliefs or practices regarding marriage.
# text = If you have any questions please feel free to call me (after Sat. the 26th, when I will return from a trip).
# text = Sign-up lists will be available at the services on Feb. 27 and March 6, or you can email me.
# text = I will email names and email addresses (or postal addresses) of signers to NCRC4ME in time for their “lobby day” in Raleigh on March 15.
# text = Thank you for your consideration of this issue.

# text = North Carolina Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality Declaration of Religious Leaders April 19, 2004
# text = The most fundamental human right, after the necessities of food, clothing and shelter, is the right to affection and the supportive love of other human beings.
# text = We become most fully human when we love another person.
# text = We can grow in our capacity to be human - to be loving - in a family unit.
# text = This right to love and form a family is so fundamental that our United States Constitution takes it for granted in its dedication to "secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.”
# text = The North Carolina Constitution likewise affirms the “inalienable rights” of human beings to "life, liberty, the enjoyment of the fruits of their own labor, and the pursuit of happiness."
# text = Throughout history, tyrants have known that by denying the right of oppressed peoples to form and nurture families, they can kill the spirit of those peoples.
# text = >From the shameful history of slavery in America, the injustice of forbidding people to marry is evident as a denial of a basic human right.
# text = The American laws forbidding interracial marriage, now struck down, were clearly discriminatory.
# text = Denial of the status of marriage to those who would freely accept its responsibilities creates legal and economic inequities and social injustice.
# text = We feel called to protest and oppose this injustice.
# text = As religious people, clergy and lay leaders, we are mandated by faith to stand for justice in our common civic life.
# text = We oppose the use of sacred texts and religious traditions to deny legal equity to same-gender couples.
# text = As concerned citizens we affirm the liberty of adults of the same gender to love and marry.
# text = We insist that no one, especially the state, is allowed to coerce people into marriage or bar two consenting adults, whether of the same or differing genders, from forming the family unit that lets them be more fully loving, thus more fully human.
# text = We respect the fact that debate and discussion continue in many of our religious communities as to the scriptural, theological and liturgical issues involved.
# text = However, we draw on our many faith traditions to arrive at a common conviction.
# text = We are resolved that the State should not interfere with same-gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights, responsibilities, and commitments of civil marriage.
# text = We affirm freedom of conscience in this matter.
# text = We recognize that the state may not require religious groups to officiate at, or bless, same-gender marriages.
# text = Likewise, a denial of state civil recognition dishonors the religious convictions of those communities and clergy who officiate at, and bless, same-gender marriages.
# text = The state may not favor the convictions of one religious group over another by denying individuals their fundamental right to marry and to have those marriages recognized by civil law.
# text = As faith leaders, we commit ourselves to public action, visibility, education, and mutual support in the service of the right and freedom to marry.

# text = The One Reason Why All Americans Should Oppose The Nomination Of Samuel Alito
# text = He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances, Giving Far Too Much Power To The President
# text = My Fellow Americans:
# text = As many of you may have heard, President Bush has nominated a long-time Federal Judge named Samuel Alito to become the next member of the United States Supreme Court, to fill a vacancy created by the retirement of another member of the Court.
# text = Under our Constitution, this nomination cannot take effect unless and until the United States Senate gives its Consent, as described in our Constitution, Article II, Section 2.
# text = A copy of the Constitution, with links back to the official source, is located at http://loveallpeople.org/usconstitutiona.txt
# text = Judge Samuel Alito is very highly qualified by all of the normal standards used to evaluate candidates for this position:
# text = He has a very high intellect.
# text = He graduated very high in his class, from Princeton undergraduate and from Law School at Yale.
# text = He has a long and distinguished record, including many years as a Federal Appeals Judge, the next level below Supreme Court.
# text = He has encyclopedic knowledge of hundreds of different Supreme Court cases, and he can recite details from memory.
# text = He demonstrates an excellent "Judicial Temperament," being courteous, mild-mannered, respectful of all people; careful in his work, meticulous in detail.
# text = His co-workers love him.
# text = His fellow judges love him.
# text = His family loves him.
# text = President Bush loves him.
# text = Yes, it is true that some people don't like the way they think he will vote on the Supreme Court.
# text = But other people do like the way they think he will vote, and the ones who favor him seem to outnumber the ones who oppose him.
# text = So now the Senate is getting ready to vote soon, on whether to approve him or not; and at this moment (evening of Jan. 27, 2006) it looks like he has more than the fifty-one votes needed for approval.
# text = The President is very eager to go ahead quickly and get this vote, because he very much wants to have Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court, to be judging the cases Bush is interested in.
# text = So there is a lot of hurry-up pressure on the Senate to give its prompt vote of approval.
# text = There is an old saying that applies in this situation: "Act in haste, repent at leisure."
# text = Sometimes you can make a bad decision very quickly, then regret it for many years to come.
# text = That is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito, in my opinion, because he has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in his thinking - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of Supreme Court Justice: He does not really agree with the system of "Checks and Balances" built into the Constitution, and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the "Unitary Executive Theory," which calls for vastly-increased Presidential Power at the expense of Congress and the Supreme Court.
# text = And because of this tragic flaw . . .
# text = "He Would Tear Down Our System Of Checks And Balances, Giving Far Too Much Power To The President."
# text = In our Constitutional system, we have three branches of the Federal Government: the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches.
# text = And the basic idea behind the Checks and Balances we have is that if one branch of the Government goes crazy, the other two can hold it down.
# text = But Samuel Alito believes in a little-known Constitutional theory - called the "Unitary Executive Theory" - which says that the President should have complete control over the Executive Branch, and that the Executive Branch should be in charge of almost everything that the Government actually does, including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control, and the Military, which exists, which is regulated, and which is funded by specific authority given by the Constitution to Congress, not to the President.
# text = The Military is not part of the Executive Branch: it is a separate entity.
# text = Under the Unitary Executive Theory, the Laws of Congress and Decisions of the Supreme Court have no actual authority unless the President agrees with them.
# text = And so Congress and the Supreme Court become mere advisors to the President, with no real authority over him.
# text = And the President becomes a Dictator, unrestrained by anything in the Constitution, backed up by the Armed Forces, which would be entirely under his personal control.
# text = And thus the United States of America - The Land Of The Free And The Home Of The Brave - becomes just another Military Dictatorship, no better than Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy during World War II.
# text = AND THAT IS WHY ALL AMERICANS SHOULD OPPOSE THE NOMINATION OF SAMUEL ALITO.

# text = NASA & Company Diplomacy - Trying to keep Moon Landing Hoax a secret in modern times
# text = Some strategies being used by NASA & Company in relation to China and other space planning countries are mentioned here after being gleaned from a news item underneath.
# text = Country has an Independent strategy = NASA & company to use "Numero Uno" strategy, try to assert, beat, mesh and control the space program of the country.
# text = This can also be through political, economical, social, and technological influence.
# text = Country not open or not have fixed strategy = NASA & Company to use "freeze thawed" strategy especially when the country has a challenging, growing and ambitious space program.
# text = This can also be through political, economical, social, and technological influence.
# text = Dependant = NASA & Company to use "space station" model to unify the aims of different countries.
# text = This is really an end goal aim of NASA & Company and also does not allow anyone challenging the moon landing hoax.
# text = The target for NASA & Company probably to get by 2018 all the ambitious space program countries shifting towards this model, through the propaganda of another moon mission; deliberately failing this or trying hard for another moon landing hoax; achieving the real aim of space unity between space programs of other countries.
# text = China launches its second manned spaceflight mission
# text = Secretive efforts keep outsiders in the dark about the program's goals
# text = By MARK CARREAU
# text = Copyright 2005 Houston Chronicle
# text = Reuters
# text = China launched Shenzhou VI, its second manned spacecraft, early today in northwest China's Gansu Province.
# text = A pair of military pilots embarked on China's second manned space flight early today, hurtling into orbit on a test mission that could span five days.
# text = The crew of the Shenzhou VI spacecraft was identified as Fei Junlong, 40, and Nie Haishen, 41, by China's official news agency.
# text = The successful launch from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China follows the solo flight of Yang Liwei in October 2003.
# text = His one-day mission vaulted his communist homeland into the elite circle of spacefaring nations - Russia and the United States - that can launch and sustain humans in space.
# text = Most experts believe China intends to develop a small space station of its own over the next several years.
# text = But they remain uncertain about whether China aims to beat the United States to the moon in its secretive space effort.
# text = President Bush has directed NASA to return to the moon by 2018 with a new generation of human explorers.
# text = China's "is not a fly-by-night program," said Joan Johnson-Freese, an expert on national security who follows space developments in the Asian nation at the Naval War College in Newport, R.I.
# text = "They are not in any hurry.
# text = They want a program that will be a success," Johnson-Freese said.
# text = "They are not going to rush it, because they don't want it to be a budget buster.
# text = Economics will be a big determiner in the speed of their program."
# text = China's overtures to join the U.S.-led effort to develop the 16-nation international space station have been thwarted for more than a decade over a range of issues, including the Asian country's human rights policies and worries it could acquire technologies that could pose a security threat.
# text = The freeze thawed some after Yang's 2003 mission.
# text = China was among 30 nations invited to send a delegate to NASA-sponsored roundtable discussions on Bush's strategy to reach the moon with astronauts as the first step in the exploration of Mars and other-deep space destinations.
# text = "We applaud China's space achievements," NASA spokesman Allard Beutel said Tuesday.
# text = "We wish them a successful return of their astronauts."
# text = He stressed, however, that NASA would not follow this week's Chinese mission through formal channels.
# text = At present, there are no plans for additional meetings with foreign powers to discuss the Bush exploration initiative or to extend an invitation to China to join the space station partnership, Beutel said.
# text = The flight of Fei and Nie could mark the end of the opening chapter in a three-phase Chinese space initiative, Johnson-Freese said.
# text = The first phase, she said, will demonstrate the capability of a multi-compartment spacecraft that will leave a test module in orbit when the two fliers return to Earth.
# text = The Chinese program's second phase will include spacewalks on future missions and demonstrations of docking and undocking techniques.
# text = The final phase will feature the assembly and operation of a longer-duration space lab.
# text = At least one expert believes China's intentions might include a surprise attempt to circle the moon with astronauts before NASA's planned lunar return.
# text = "The Americans would be wise to plan accordingly," said John E. Pike, director of the Alexandria, Va.-based GlobalSecurity.org, a small national security think tank.
# text = "There is always the possibility they could jam us up, make us look like we are not numero uno," Pike said.
# text = During the U.S. and Russian lunar race during the Cold War, NASA scored an early coup by circling the moon with the Apollo 8 crew over the 1968 Christmas holidays.
# text = As it turned out, the Soviets never made it to the moon.
# text = "(China) could be the second country to do that," Pike said.
# text = "They would get in line in front of the Russians.
# text = And they would not have to land on the moon to take us down a notch."
# text = Pike's concern is based on China's development of a new medium-lift rocket, the Long March V, and the construction of a new space launch complex on Hainan Island in the South China Sea.
# text = The two developments, he said, could eventually enable China's space program to mature to the point that experts could assemble and launch from Earth's orbit a spacecraft capable of circling the moon with astronauts and returning home.

# text = I'm a member of a local animal rights news, and get regular emails from other members and the staff.
# text = Recently, I read an email that reported the horrific nightmare Civet Cats go through by sick losers who put them in sheds and heat the inside of the sheds up to 110 degrees with fires, so that they can periodically scrape the sweat off of their genitals and sell it to corrupt corporations who use it to prolong the scent of perfumes.
# text = The animals eventually die, which is because these demons are so GREEDY, they want as much of their "product" as they can get, instead of letting the cats go after a point, as an act of humanity, mercy, love.
# text = Below I pasted the email text, and it has a link to a website that automatically plays this song the author of the email created.
# text = It has cat's "Meowing" for the vocals, and you might really find yourself in those furnaces, feeling and thinking those terrible feelings and thoughts that these cats do before they die.
# text = Right now, while we're sitting at our computers enjoying the internet, those innocent, beautiful, loving cats, are dying, somewhere in this troubled world a slow, agonizing death.
# text = The main reason I wrote this post is to ask anyone reading this if they know of some way I can help put a stop to this Cat Holocaust.
# text = I am serious about doing something.
# text = If I love cats so much, why aren't I DOING something???
# text = I don't want to appear before God on judgment day and have to explain why I didn't do anything like this in my life.
# text = Any suggestions would be appreciated.
# text = Here's the text of the email:
# text = Hi there,
# text = I read the Civet Cat story from a little while ago, and tonight, when my Mom emailed me about it, I re-read it, and went to the website with the song the author of the email created.
# text = Well, sure enough, when I heard the cats "Meowing," I imagined the hellish moments these poor beautiful creatures of God were living, what went on in their tiny, sweet little minds, and decided that I want to do something about this torture.
# text = So, if anyone can give me some advice, I'd sure appreciate it!
# text = I think for starters, myself and those of you who believe in God could say a special prayer for them.
# text = I will.
# text = I've pasted the email for those who haven't seen or would like to re-read it.
# text = It's also got the website where the song has been uploaded.
# text = I was thinking, that while I'm sitting here, relaxing and enjoying myself, those poor innocent animals are being cooked to death with heat in those Holocaust-esque death chambers.
# text = And what am I DOING about it?

# text = Subject: Civet Cats, James Rachels + a song
# text = This is my first time posting to the list, so I feel somewhat embarrassed by "promoting" a song I wrote, but I think it is fitting because it is directly tied to extreme animal suffering as a result of human lack of empathy, but an abundance of human greed.
# text = I'm not sure if any of you know much about civet cats, but to brief those who might not know, I will quote James Rachels, author of World Hunger and Moral Obligation among many other animal rights-related books and articles.
# text = (I kind of see him to be for animal rights theory as Peter Singer is to the theory of utilitarianism applied to non-human animals).
# text = The quote is from an article entitled "Vegetarianism and `The Other Weight Problem'"
# text = If anyone wants the complete article, email me, as it is a very good article which no meat-eater can read and not sense their own hypocrisy.
# text = But this is what he says about civet cats:
# text = "As an example, consider the treatment of the civet cat, a highly intelligent and sociable animal.
# text = Civet cats are trapped and placed in small cages inside darkened sheds, where the temperature is kept up to 110 F by fires.
# text = They are confined in this way until they finally die.
# text = What justifies this extraordinary mistreatment?
# text = These animals have the misfortune to produce a substance that is useful in the manufacture of perfume.
# text = (The heat increases their "production" of musk.)
# text = Here Kant's rule--"Animals are merely means to an end; that end is man"--is applied with a vengeance.
# text = To promote one of the most trivial interests we have, thousands of animals are tormented for their whole lives."
# text = This article, and specifically this piece, effected me enough to try to build a song around the topic.
# text = If anyone is interested in listening to this song, and in offering their opinion, whether it be positive or negative, I'd appreciate it.
# text = But I also hope no one feels any obligation to download, especially if you have an internet connection as slow mine (28k).
# text = The url for the song is http://www.sonic.net/~fsjob/TragiCore-TheCivetCat.mp3
# text = Although there are no human vocals/lyrics, I think it's subject matter is audible.
# text = Again, if anyone wants to read Rachels' entire article, let me know.
# text = It's also on the net.
# text = I was already a vegetarian when I read it a little more than a year ago, but it was one of the bigger factors for me in going completely vegan.
# text = I hope all are well.

# text = -------------------
# text = .: GO VEGAN :.
# text = MAKE THOUSANDS!!! --
# text = THIS IS NOT A SCAM!!!
# text = I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it: I don't care about the useless pre-fabricated crap this message usually says.
# text = All I say is, it works.
# text = Continue pre-fab crap.
# text = WELL GUESS WHAT!!!
# text = Within seven days, I started getting money in the mail!!
# text = I was shocked!!
# text = I figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in.
# text = In my first week, I made about $25.00.
# text = By the end of the second week I had made a total of more than $1000.00!!
# text = In the third week I had more than $10,000.00 and it's still growing!!
# text = This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of $42,000.00 and it's still coming rapidly.
# text = It's certainly worth $6.00 and six stamps, and I have spent more than that on the lottery without ever winning!!!
# text = Let me tell you how this works and most important, why it works..........
# text = also make sure you print this out NOW, so you can get the information off of it, as you will need it.
# text = I promise you that if you follow the directions exactly that you will start making more money than you thought possible by doing something so easy!!
# text = Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully!!
# text = (Print it out or download it)
# text = Follow the simple directions and watch the money come in!!
# text = It's easy.
# text = It's legal.
# text = And, your investment is only $6.00 (Plus postage) !!!
# text = IMPORTANT:
# text = This is not a rip-off, it is decent; it's legal; and it is virtually no risk - it really works!!
# text = If all the following instructions are adhered to, you will receive extraordinary dividends.
# text = PLEASE NOTE:
# text = Please follow the directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60 days.
# text = This program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants.
# text = Please continue its success by carefully adhering to the instructions.
# text = You will now become apart of the Mail Order business.
# text = You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists.
# text = Many large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists.
# text = However, the money made from the mailing lists is secondary to income which is made from people like you and me asking to be included in that list.
# text = Here are the four easy steps to success.
# text = STEP ONE:
# text = Get six separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of paper "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST."
# text = Now get 6 U.S. $1.00 bills and place ONE inside of EACH of the six pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope (to prevent thievery).
# text = Next, place one paper in each of the six envelopes and seal them.
# text = You now should have six sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a $1.00 bill.
# text = What you are doing is creating a service.
# text = THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!!!!!
# text = You are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for it!!
# text = Like most of us I was a little skeptical and little worried about the legal aspects of it all.
# text = So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-238-5355) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal!!
# text = Mail the six envelopes to the following addresses:
# text = 1) G. Burrows 1/264 Tor St Toowoomba QLD 4350 Australia
# text = 2)S Luest P.O. Box 366 Garden Grove, CA 92842 USA
# text = 3) G.V. & A. Bourret 41 Broome St, #1 Brooklyn, NY 11222 USA
# text = 4)R. Ansems Gen. Foulkesstraat 5 4641 BW Ossendrecht Netherlands
# text = 5)W. Brumbley 4632 Hilton Ave Suite # 31 Columbus, Ohio 43228
# text = STEP TWO:Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the other names up (six becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, and etc.) and add YOUR NAME as number 6 on the list.
# text = STEP THREE:
# text = Change anything you need to but try to keep this article as close to original as possible.
# text = Now post your amended article to at least 200 news groups. :
# text = (I think there are close to 24,000 groups)
# text = All you need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the more money you make!!
# text = This is perfectly legal!!
# text = If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18 Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the Postal Lottery laws.
# text = Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and whenever you need money, you can use it again, and again.
# text = PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants and by their carefully adhering to directions.
# text = Look at it this way.
# text = If you were of integrity, the program will continue and the money that so many others have received will come your way.
# text = NOTE: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you, either on a computer or hard copy and keep the notes people send you.
# text = This VERIFIES that you are truly providing a service.
# text = (Also, it might be a good idea to wrap the $1 bill in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail theft).
# text = So, as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, all members will be reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with one dollar each.
# text = Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when your name reaches the #1 position you will be receiving thousands of dollars in CASH!!!
# text = What an opportunity for only $6.00 ( $1.00 for each of the first six people listed above)
# text = Send it now, add your own name to the list and you're in business!!!
# text = *****DIRECTIONS FOR HOW TO POST TO NEWS GROUPS!!!*****
# text = STEP ONE: You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own posting.
# text = Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of this document, and select 'copy' from the edit menu.
# text = This will copy the entire letter into the computer's memory.
# text = STEP TWO:
# text = Open a blank 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top of the blank page.
# text = From the 'edit' menu select 'paste'.
# text = This will paste a copy of the letter into the notepad so that you will add your name to the list.
# text = STEP THREE:
# text = Save your new notepad file as a text file.
# text = If you want to do your posting in different settings, you'll always have this file to go back to.
# text = STEP FOUR:
# text = Visit message boards and post this article as a new message by highlighting the text of this letter and selecting paste from the edit menu.
# text = Fill in the subject, this will be the header that everyone sees as they scroll through the list of postings in a particular group, click the post message button.
# text = You're done.
# text = Congratulations!!!!!!
# text = THAT'S IT!!
# text = All you have to do, and It Really works!!!
# text = Best Wishes
# text = Blue Planet: Who's afraid of Big Bad Wolf?
# text = By Dan Whipple
# text = UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL
# text = Boulder, CO, Feb. 23 (UPI) --
# text = Ever since he ate up Red Riding Hood's grandma and blew down the houses of two-thirds of the Three Little Pigs, the Big Bad Wolf has held a persistently bad reputation.
# text = In part because of that reputation, the gray wolf was nearly exterminated from the lower 48 states by the 1920s, except for a small remnant population on Isle Royale National Park in Michigan's Lake Superior.
# text = The last wolf was killed in Yellowstone National Park in 1943.
# text = Western sheep and cattle ranchers, on whose behalf this extermination campaign was conducted, gratefully dusted their hands of the wolf and wrote him off as a job well done.
# text = Their sheep could graze, their cows could ruminate and never a discouraging word would be heard.
# text = After the major kill-offs, wolves outside of Alaska and Canada existed mostly as legend.
# text = Like UFOs or Sasquatch, several people claimed to see fleeting lone wolves, usually in Yellowstone.
# text = In the 1960s, a group shooting a movie in the Wyoming park reportedly imported some captive wolves, then released them when their shooting was done.
# text = If so, this happy band has not been heard from since.
# text = Rumor also had it some renegade biologist brought a caged pair to Yellowstone and released them into the wild sometime in the 1970s, hoping to reestablish a breeding population.
# text = If true, the caper failed.
# text = Over time, the wolf's absence seemed to rehabilitate its image.
# text = Eventually, a trickle of support appeared for bringing the predator back to its former home range in the northern Rocky Mountains.
# text = This trickle grew into a flood, resulting in 14 wolves being reintroduced in Yellowstone in 1995 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service -- albeit over the strong and still-continuing objections of ranchers.
# text = These wolf packs have flourished, and now there are an estimated 850 wolves roaming the northern Rockies, where merely 10 years ago there were none.
# text = One compelling argument for reintroduction was the wolf acts as a keystone predator, an animal that affects the populations, behavior and ecology of a wide variety of species within its range.
# text = Some recent research conducted by Oregon State University has given considerable credence to this idea.
# text = OSU forestry professors William Ripple and Robert Beschta have found that wolves actually promote stream-bank stabilization, although they have given the phenomenon the unfortunate name of "the ecology of fear" -- something that smacks of the horrible PR resulting from the wolf's relationships with Riding Hood and the Three Pigs.
# text = They explained that elk in Yellowstone used to browse unmolested on young aspen and willow growing near the banks of streams, a behavior that prevented the saplings from reaching mature stages and increased the possibility of soil erosion.
# text = Since reintroduction, however, Ripple and Beschta have found, fear of the wolves apparently has discouraged the elk from spending too much time at stream banks -- where they are out in the open -- and munching on the saplings.
# text = "All you have to do is look at the photographs," Ed Bangs, wolf recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told UPI's Blue Planet,
# text = "You say, 'wow!'
# text = An area that used to be bald as a billiard ball is now a sea of willow."
# text = This simple change has triggered a veritable ecological cascade in Yellowstone.
# text = More streamside willow and aspen have meant better habitat for beaver, for instance.
# text = Where there had been only one beaver colony in the park's northern range before the wolves returned, now there are nine.
# text = "It may be uninteresting to a lot of people," Beschta told Blue Planet.
# text = "There's a lot of impact on plants and they say, 'Who cares?'
# text = But we've been looking at streamside communities.
# text = Since wolf recovery, streamside plants, willows and cottonwoods provide food for other critters -- beavers, a whole variety of avian species, berry-producing shrubs that bears can use.
# text = It's important with regard to the quality of streams.
# text = The plants provide shade and root strength for bank stability.
# text = Plants are critical to wildland ecosystems."
# text = Yellowstone has a vast elk herd, one of the largest in the world.
# text = Bangs said although the number of elk has not declined very much since the wolves came back, their behavior appears markedly different.
# text = "I'm pretty suspicious of making broad generalizations," however, he cautioned.
# text = "Wolves are still pretty new.
# text = They've only been there for 10 years.
# text = In 10 more years we'll have a better idea."
# text = Wolf reintroduction in the northern Rockies has been so successful the Fish and Wildlife Service has moved to reduce the animal's status from endangered to threatened and, eventually, to remove it from the endangered species list altogether.
# text = Bangs said the agency has established viable wolf packs in the northern Rockies, as required by federal regulations.
# text = Some conservationists want the protection extended so wolves can move into other states, including Colorado, Utah and Oregon, among others.
# text = On Jan. 31, Oregon Federal District Court Judge Robert E. Jones appeared to agree with them.
# text = He vacated the FWS decision to downgrade the wolf's status.
# text = Bangs said his agency is still reviewing the decision.
# text = Regardless of the wolf's legal status, its future expansion into new areas now seems likely.
# text = Wolves can migrate considerable distances.
# text = A Yellowstone wolf was found dead, hit by a car, on a Colorado highway last year, several hundred miles from home.
# text = Meanwhile, his reputation seems to be improving, although Bangs noted a "pretty interesting social dynamic."
# text = There are only about 850 wolves in the West, but there are an estimated 31,000 mountain lions.
# text = Pound for pound, mountain lions eat more game and more livestock than wolves.
# text = They even occasionally attack people, which wolves do not -- despite the propaganda from the Brothers Grimm.
# text = Yet people seem willing -- even eager -- to accommodate mountain lions, despite the risks.
# text = It remains to be seen whether they will extend the same courtesy to the arriving gray wolf.
# text = Regarding those rumors about wolves living in Yellowstone prior to the official reintroduction?
# text = They seem to be just that: rumors.
# text = True, there are about 300,000 wolves and wolf hybrids kept as pets in the United States.
# text = It also is likely people have released some of these animals into the wild hoping they would survive -- for instance, a ranger in Glacier Park caught someone in this very act not long ago.
# text = Bangs said these animals are not equipped to survive in the wild, however, and they all almost certainly have died.
# text = He said after 10 years of DNA testing on northern Rockies wolves, scientists have not found a single strain that did not belong to one of the wolves the agency released -- or their descendants.

# text = Climate: Humans fuss, animals adjust
# text = By Dan Whipple
# text = UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL
# text = Boulder, CO, Nov. 15 (UPI) --
# text = Scientists can argue all they want about how many degrees Celsius -- or Fahrenheit -- the planet is warming and what the trend portends, but meanwhile Earth's plants, insects and animals are not waiting for the outcome.
# text = They already are altering their patterns of behavior in response to what is happening.
# text = It turns out one of the surest barometers of the warming climate is the response of the non-human natural world to changing conditions, and biologists who study the responses have been aware for some years the biosphere is acknowledging global warming.
# text = Nina Leopold Bradley, a plant ecologist and daughter of the conservation pioneer Aldo Leopold, published a 1999 paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on her 61-year uninterrupted phenological records.
# text = Phenology studies an organism's development and life cycle -- the pulse of life.
# text = Bradley's record of 300 phenophases found that even prior to 1999, spring was arriving in higher latitudes several weeks earlier than in the earlier years of her data.
# text = Birds arrived sooner on their migrations from the south and plants flowered earlier.
# text = The Eastern phoebe is showing up about 20 days before it used to.
# text = The forest phlox is blooming in late April instead of mid-May.
# text = Half of the 300 phenophases Leopold tracked showed a response consistent with warming.
# text = In England, the cuckoo returns earlier.
# text = An analysis of 65 bird species in the United Kingdom shows about one-third are laying their eggs four to seven days earlier than they did 25 years ago.
# text = "One of the major, most well-documented and robust findings in ecology over the past century has been the crucial role of climate in determining the geographical distribution of species and ecological communities," concluded a report titled "Observed Impacts of Global Climate Change in the United States," released by the Pew Center on Global Climate last week.
# text = Pew researchers looked at about 40 studies that could provide an assessment of whether climate was affecting biology.
# text = "Half of the studies provide strong evidence of a causal link between the biological change and climate change," said Camille Parmesan, a University of Texas-Austin biologist and one of the world's leading experts on this issue.
# text = These changes are occurring across all species, Parmesan told UPI's Climate.
# text = "Across the United States, the northern edge of species' range is expanding," she said.
# text = Parmesan has spent much of her career studying the checkerspot butterfly, which migrates between Mexico and southern California.
# text = Some localized extinctions already have occurred across some of its habitat.
# text = "Empirical research pointed to climate as being a strong driver," she said.
# text = "There have been large numbers of population extinctions in Mexico and southern California in areas where the habitat is still acceptable."
# text = According to Parmesan's earlier studies, one extinction event, for instance, was triggered when a checkerspot population migrated north prematurely, relying on a warming temperature signal, then was caught in a severe snowstorm in its northern habitat.
# text = Throughout the United States, she said, "spring is about two weeks earlier.
# text = Tree swallows are nesting nine days earlier.
# text = Tropical species have moved up to Florida and the Gulf Coast.
# text = Bird and butterfly watchers are seeing many, many new species coming up from Mexico and the Caribbean."
# text = As the Pew report concluded, "Sufficient studies now exist to conclude that the consequences of climate change are already detectable within U.S. ecosystems."
# text = Such consequences include shifting and, in some cases, contraction of ranges and changes in species composition within ecosystems.
# text = The report also found alterations of ecosystem processes such as carbon cycling and storage.
# text = The Alaskan tundra, for instance, has switched from being a net sink of carbon dioxide -- absorbing and storing more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases -- to "being a net source of CO2 (releasing more carbon than is stored) because warmer winters have allowed dead plant matter previously stored in the soil to decompose and release CO2."
# text = The Pew report coincided with the release in Iceland of the "Arctic Climate Impact Assessment."
# text = The ACIA -- with participation by the United States, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation and Sweden -- was begun in 2000.
# text = "The impacts of global warming are affecting people now in the Arctic," said ACIA chair Robert Corell.
# text = "The Arctic is experiencing some of the most rapid and severe climate change on Earth.
# text = The impacts of climate change on the region and the globe are projected to increase substantially in the years to come."
# text = The ACIA found Arctic winter temperatures have increased 4 degrees to 7 degrees Fahrenheit in the last 50 years and should go up about twice that much in the next 100 years.
# text = Arctic summer sea ice will decline by 50 percent by the end of the 21st century, the assessment found, with some models predicting complete disappearance of summer sea ice.
# text = "Should the Arctic Ocean become ice-free in summer, it is likely that polar bears and some seal species would be driven toward extinction," the report concluded.
# text = As with so much climate research, not everyone agrees with these dire predictions.
# text = A third report, "The Impacts of Climate Change: An Appraisal for the Future," completed by the Britain-based International Policy Network and released almost simultaneously with the other two, falls somewhat into that category.
# text = On the one hand, the IPN report agreed "Climate models generally predict that the temperature rises in the Arctic will substantially exceed the global rise.
# text = This applies especially in the high Arctic where the ice cover is expected to diminish substantially with the effect that the surface absorption of solar radiation will greatly increase."
# text = On the other hand, the report thinks the news might not be so bad for the North Atlantic fisheries.
# text = "The impact of global warming on fish stocks and fisheries is hard to judge," the IPN report said.
# text = "A warming of the magnitude predicted is more likely than not to be beneficial to the fisheries of the North Atlantic."
# text = The important commercial species that probably would benefit from warming include cod, haddock, saithe, herring, blue whiting and several types of flatfish and crustaceans -- such as the Norway lobster.
# text = Important species that probably would decline include shrimp, capelin, Greenland halibut and some varieties of flatfish.
# text = Hidden in this laundry list -- and in the pile of studies examined by the Pew researchers -- is one of the fundamental chasms dividing participants in the global warming debate.
# text = The IPN report examines commercial fish species, but it neglects important non-commercial animals, such as seals and polar bears.
# text = In a limited economic sense, therefore, the organization can argue warming might be a good thing.
# text = The problem is whether one cares what happens to the polar bears, checkerspot butterflies and other unconsumables.
# text = The Pew researchers tried to transcend the economic argument.
# text = They assumed a value -- unspecified -- for non-commercial species, and in doing so rendered the warming news a bit less rosy.
# text = This tug-of-war over calculating economic values is the one that ultimately will have to be decided by humans, because animals and plants can adjust only so much.
# text = "When dandelions have set the mark of May on Wisconsin pastures, it is time to listen for the final proof of spring," wrote Aldo Leopold in "A Sand County Almanac."
# text = "Sit down on a tussock, cock your ears at the sky, dial out the bedlam of meadowlarks and redwings, and soon you may hear it: the flight of the upland plover, just now back from the Argentine."

# text = How has Katrina changed the US?
# text = What will be the lasting effects of Hurricane Katrina and what can be learnt from the response?
# text = Relief agencies are trying to help hundreds of thousands of displaced people while authorities have vowed to restore security in New Orleans following a breakdown of law and order.
# text = In the world press, commentators predict that Katrina will make a profound change in the way the US is perceived at home and abroad, especially following the scenes of poverty and racial divisions they believe the disaster has revealed.
# text = Meanwhile, President George W Bush has said he will lead an inquiry into how the disaster was handled.
# text = How has Katrina changed the US?
# text = Has it altered your life?
# text = Has the disaster affected the way other countries view the US?
# text = Send us your comments using the form.
# text = ---->===}*{===<----
# text = Some of the better comments:
# text = "As an American, I would like to take this opportunity to tell all the 'USA and Bush Bashers' that I am appalled at the number of 'allies' that are using this disaster as their podium to spread their useless opinions.
# text = What you see in New Orleans is a perfect example of the downfalls of the welfare system, a form of socialism that many in this country know is the true problem.
# text = You have seen the pictures.
# text = You people think it is race, but it is not.
# text = It is the welfare society that was New Orleans."
# text = --Paul, Atlanta, USA
# text = "I am frankly revolted by the response of the Bush-Bashers; "Sorry chaps, but you did have it coming..."
# text = The plain fact is that Bush has a sight more in the way of common humanity than a great many of his detractors.
# text = At least he isn't using this disaster for cheap political point-scoring."
# text = --Mac, Nottingham
# text = "I do not feel it has changed the US citizens which is what was needed, even now the majority want "Gas" despite the fact they are polluting the world more than any other country in the world and refuse to stop, perhaps this natural disaster, which let's face it looks like a product of Global Warming, will change their views, why not pick things up with your hands and walk with your legs, other people in the world do it, "Gas" is not the be all and end all!"
# text = --David, Kent
# text = <This man has clearly never visited the US.
# text = Distances are not what they are in the old world.
# text = Here, cars are absolutely necessary, and he'd have to have one, too.
# text = -Juggernaut>
# text = "The US will work its way through the loss of a city and we are making progress after seven short days.
# text = Thank you for your concern, but Europe is still irrelevant."
# text = --John B, Windermere, Florida
# text = <John can come over to eat at my house anytime.
# text = -Juggernaut>
# text = It is always interesting what spin the press will take.
# text = Certainly, representation of the US in other countries will have a certain depiction.
# text = I don't believe that folks who believe that America is the land of opportunity will change their views from this recent news.
# text = I have a friend who came here from Bulgaria after winning a green card in a lottery.
# text = Yes, she and her family were delighted to leave the communistic remnants in that country.
# text = Her husband became a citizen of the US just the week before last.
# text = (Believe it or not, it takes a minimum of 5 years to apply.)
# text = The countries which are giving to America to aid are a great example of the seed that America has sown through the years with other nations.
# text = Now to the poverty stricken and the racial issue...
# text = You know, I've lived in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex most of my life.
# text = When not in Texas, I lived in LA and San Francisco.
# text = There is a lot of racial diversity in all of these places... and I've vacationed through the south... visited my folks when they lived in Mississippi, and where they live now and are in the racial minority being white (less than 20%) in northeastern Arkansas.
# text = The fact is, when I began traveling for business to New England, when I first visited my in-laws in Montana and Idaho, I was shocked at the lack of racial diversity.
# text = I didn't expect to react that way, but when I was looking around my workplace in Nashua, New Hampshire, and everyone else looked pretty much like me, it was really very eerie.
# text = So, yes, America has pockets that are more diverse than others.
# text = Additionally, reviewing the standings of Louisiana and Mississippi in the educational stakes, you'll find they usually land near the bottom of a list of 50 states.
# text = Unfortunately, those left behind to be filmed, where those without transportation or means.
# text = Some refused to leave, but so many were unable to.
# text = Yes, it's a valid reflection of America - we do have cities like this.
# text = However, New Orleans also had many affluent people, people who left town early as they had the means.
# text = I don't know if this will change other nation's perceptions of America.
# text = I suspect it will not change greatly... but you never know how much stock people put in the news.
# text = I do know that this will change the face of America.
# text = I expect that many of the displaced people (those affluent and those not) will remain in the places they were evacuated to.
# text = The 1.25 million people who have been housed in stadiums and convention centers across Texas will begin to populate Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Galveston, and the surrounding areas.
# text = Sure, some will return, but I have a feeling that once many begin to get jobs and temporary housing, they may be shy about returning.
# text = I'm interested in what America will look like in 5 years.
# text = Will racial diversity find its way to Wyoming as some people are offered jobs there?
# text = Or will the nearly year-round snow be too much for those who have never experienced snow in their lives?
# text = Will the housing market in Dallas begin booming like the rest of the nation has due to the influx of buyers?
# text = Will businesses that were new in 2005 have become a household name due to their efforts in rebuilding the gulf coast?
# text = What will the federal government do to prevent inflation in the housing and building market?
# text = These are some of the things I've been wondering...
# text = Linna
# text = Response coming soon.
# text = Your reply is good and deserves something good in return.
# text = Juggernaut
# text = Okay, I'm new to this forum and really don't like Bush, so my view point is slanted and I admit that.
# text = I rarely listen to the news or to what politicians or lawyers say because so many tell lies that none have credibility so what's the point?
# text = What I know is that I have a close friend who's aunt disappeared in New Orleans.
# text = My friend didn't have computer capability, so I spent the day searching and posting online.
# text = The family here (California) wanted to fly any family members from there to CA, so they could remain here until things got straightened out down there.
# text = The cousins could not be found because no one was sure of their married names.
# text = The hope was that anyone looking for the Aunt would see the family post and know that help was available.
# text = It is Oct. 6, and not one family member has been located.
# text = What I saw was dozens of school buses submerged that could have been used to evacuate people who had no transportation.
# text = What I heard was the Mayor of New Orleans, saying that he didn't order the buses or anything else to be used because he was waiting on someone else to tell him what to do.
# text = When common sense takes a back seat to politics and legal mumbo jumbo what have we become?
# text = Recently, Bush addressed the nation.
# text = About 30 seconds into his address, he started flogging the terrorist issue just one more time.
# text = Ironically he almost burst out laughing and it was all he could do to keep his mirth down to a barely controlled smirk.
# text = Even he can't believe that he is trotting out this old saw again.
# text = I guess if you have a schtick that is a resounding success once, you can't help but trot it out every time your act is going sour.
# text = Meanwhile, every pocket that can be lined is golden and the poor are shunted off radar yet again.
# text = We have the technology; if you are going to spend billions of dollars touting "FREEDOM" why not spend those billions making all of us free?
# text = Free of polution, free of oil dependency, and free of big business that is bleeding us dry for the short term good (theirs).
# text = I'm sorry he makes me want to puke so I shut him off.
# text = In the meanwhile there are still broken families that should have been safe in the home of the brave.
# text = For those who believe....................

# text = <<After having written so far, Don Martin Decoud, the exotic dandy of the Parisian boulevard, got up and walked across the sanded floor of the cafe at one end of the Albergo of United Italy, kept by Giorgio Viola, the old companion of Garibaldi.
# text = The highly coloured lithograph of the Faithful Hero seemed to look dimly, in the light of one candle, at the man with no faith in anything except the truth of his own sensations.
# text = Looking out of the window, Decoud was met by a darkness so impenetrable that he could see neither the mountains nor the town, nor yet the buildings near the harbour; and there was not a sound, as if the tremendous obscurity of the Placid Gulf, spreading from the waters over the land, had made it dumb as well as blind. . . .
# text = He turned away.
# text = He could bear no longer that expressionless and motionless stare, which seemed to have a sort of impenetrable emptiness like the black depth of an abyss.
# text = . . . and uneasy in its corporate expression, was overtopped by the big face of Don Juste Lopez, soft and white, with prominent eyelids and wreathed in impenetrable solemnity as if in a dense cloud.>>

# text = <<He could do little during the day, for Murillo took every precaution and never went out save with his satellite Lucas, or Lopez as he was known in the days of his greatness.
# text = At night, however, he slept alone, and the avenger might find him.
# text = On a certain evening, which had been prearranged, I sent my friend final instructions, for the man was forever on the alert and continually changed his room.
# text = I was to see that the doors were open and the signal of a green or white light in a window which faced the drive was to give notice if all was safe or if the attempt had better be postponed.
# text = "But everything went wrong with us.
# text = In some way I had excited the suspicion of Lopez, the secretary.
# text = He crept up behind me and sprang upon me just as I had finished the note.
# text = He and his master dragged me to my room and held judgment upon me as a convicted traitress.
# text = Then and there they would have plunged their knives into me could they have seen how to escape the consequences of the deed.
# text = Finally, after much debate, they concluded that my murder was too dangerous.
# text = But they determined to get rid forever of Garcia.
# text = They had gagged me, and Murillo twisted my arm round until I gave him the address.
# text = I swear that he might have twisted it off had I understood what it would mean to Garcia.
# text = Lopez addressed the note which I had written, sealed it with his sleeve-link, and sent it by the hand of the servant, Jose.
# text = How they murdered him I do not know, save that it was Murillo's hand who struck him down, for Lopez had remained to guard me.
# text = I believe he must have waited among the gorse bushes through which the path winds and struck him down as he passed.
# text = At first they were of a mind to let him enter the house and to kill him as a detected burglar; but they argued that if they were mixed up in an inquiry their own identity would at once be publicly disclosed and they would be open to further attacks.
# text = With the death of Garcia, the pursuit might cease, since such a death might frighten others from the task.>>

# text = The Rock revolution happened in the Sixties (6, number of the Beast).
# text = It came from Liverpool, that was the port base to the Titanic, destroyed by God because of the arrogant insult of captain Smith (also from Liverpool): "Not even God can sink my ship" (not only the captain, but also the rest of the crew and even the orchestra playing at the Titanic were from Liverpool).
# text = The Rock revolution came from the nation that allows a church to be changed to a pub or to a dance room or to a recording studio full of drug addicts, homosexuals and lunatics (as that of George Martin, ally of the Beatles).
# text = It came from the nation whose king Enrique VIII adulterated the Bible so that divorce could be allowed and in this way be able to give loose rein to the many divorces from his wives and subsequent murdering of the same ones and to whom God provided a wife with six fingers as abomination (Anne Boleyn)...once again 6, number of the Beast....
# text = It is interesting to observe that this nation is nicknamed "the Devil's Island".
# text = As the epithet of the government of Satan on that nation, the center of London, the so well-known Piccadilly Circus, takes it's name from an old brothel (the "Piccadilla House" which means "The House of Sin"), disappeared nowadays.
# text = The antichrist John Lennon, one of the Devil's main puppets to destroy family, social and moral values and to begin the disintegration of mankind, did hit Stuart Sutcliffe (the first bass player of the Beatles) in the head with a club repeatedly in Hamburg.
# text = Some months later Sutcliffe died from brain haemorrhage because of John Lennon's bruises.
# text = John Lennon entered stardom being a murderer.
# text = The same demons that made captain Smith say "Not even God can sink my ship" spoke from antichrist John Lennon (from Liverpool, base port to the Titanic) saying: "Christianity is on the go.
# text = It will vanish and shrink.
# text = We are more popular than Jesus and Pope"....
# text = That was the day that GOD'S CURSE fell upon the world of Rock.
# text = One week after that declaration, ONLY ONE WEEK LATER, Brian Epstein, forger of the Beatle farce, died from an overdose.
# text = From then on, the Beatles began to get involved in false religions and to preach them to the world.
# text = John Lennon's divorce followed, as well as his entering the world of black magic, as deeply as to buy the apartment. where the "Rosemary's baby" had been filmed, previous property of Roman Polansky, and in that same apartment John Lennon had a room upholstered with black silk where he used to do his black magic operations.
# text = Came the disintegration of the Beatles' minds with LSD which has caused, among others, schizophrenic lyrics such as "I am the Walrus" and incoherent schizophrenic musical expositions like "Revolution number 9".
# text = At the same time, the devil acted through his other main puppets with "Sympathy for the devil" that was when the pact of the Rolling Stones with Satan took the life of the founder of the group, the guitarist Brian Jones (who refused to be a puppet of the devil), murdered by people sent by Mick Jagger, another assassin.
# text = Antichrist John Lennon wanted to compete with Jesus Christ, and so he grew a beard and started to make a bogus role of Christ together with Yoko Ono at the Amsterdam Hilton hotel proclaiming "Peace", being then when he was visited by the Canadian journalist who ridiculized and admonished him wanting to know about what Lennon meant when he wrote in the lyrics of "The ballad of John and Yoko": "the way things are going, they're going to crucify me...", The CURSE OF GOD upon John Lennon carried on with all type of miseries and distresses which made Lennon give the interview to the "Rolling Stone" magazine (today condensed in the "Lennon remembers" book) where he speaks about how bad thing were going for him blaming "whatever is up there" for it (referring to God).
# text = The CURSE OF GOD carried on until he was shot dead.
# text = It is interesting to notice that he was shot seven times, being seven, as well as three, the holy numbers in Holy Cabalah tradition....
# text = After George Harrison, said arrogantly in a video filmed in his studio at Henley on Thames: "I want to talk about the divinity of man", he was given throat cancer by GOD because of those words, which made metastasis and carried on to final death..
# text = To Paul McCartney whose company's logo was a person toying with the planets as if he was a god, and who was being very much deluded in his ego trip by the fact that he was made "Sir" (when in England even the road sweeper is made Sir, as long as he produces money for the nation), GOD provided cancer to the wife.
# text = The advertising farce of how much he loved Linda (woman whose quality he did not deserve), was exposed when it was known that Paul had an affair with Heather Mills, Linda's intimate friend, with whom McCartney went on a trip to New York and to whom he bought things and presents, while he was still mourning for his "dear Linda".
# text = At the same time McCartney was going out with Heather Mills, he used Linda's death for promotional ends, due to his waning popularity.
# text = Paul admitted that he made Linda suffer a lot, but he didn't say that it was because he felt insecure as a man due to his womanish face and effeminate manners and also because with his age his sexual power was not the same, even though it has never been much.
# text = The early days were the days of competition between Paul and his wife and John and his wife and he knew he had to compete with ugly John for the leadership of the band in front of their wives and having Yoko Ono made him aware of his lack of virility and repressed homosexuality, he grew the beard that we see in the "Let it Be" film and started to show pictures of naked women in the same film, doing every effort he could to be seen as a man....
# text = It is easy to note the uneasiness of McCartney when he sings: "I've got a feeling, a feeling I can't hide..." in front of Yoko in the film.
# text = (He already had the traumas that his previous girlfriend Jane Asher had caused him when she made him aware of his little manliness and effeminate manners).
# text = Paul has such a big inferiority complex as a man, due to his effeminate face, body and personality and due to his repressed homosexuality, that he found himself a handicapped woman with only one leg, so that he could stand out, being very conscious that a full woman would make him feel the superiority of virile men again, as Jane and Linda did.
# text = This is something that his ego trip of lucky bad musician could not face anymore....
# text = He is very conscious that money and fame cannot buy virility and manliness.
# text = Besides being a murderer, John Lennon had sexual intercourse with homosexual Brian Epstein to get him interested in going to see the band at the Cavern, trauma from which he never recovered.
# text = Because of the trauma that his homosexual relation with Brian Epstein had left him, he made lyrics such as: "You can wear a collar and a tie, one thing you can't hide is when you're crippled inside" and gave declarations to the "Rolling Stone" magazine saying that "sometimes he wore Texan boots to feel more secure as a man".
# text = The Beatles are very well known by people close to them for their arrogance and racism.
# text = One of the manifestations of their racism is the rejection towards Japanese Yoko Ono.
# text = That rejection got to the point that George Harrison kicked Yoko Ono in the Apple studios during the filming of Let it Be.
# text = When John asked George while they were having lunch about how things were going for Paul after his separation from the Beatles and George replied that he was number one in the Swedish hit parade, John said in a despective manner: "ah!!.. in Sweden..", as if Sweden was an inferior place or something alike.
# text = In the Beatles' song "Get Back" they advise black Joe to "get back to where you once belonged", as if England was not a place for black people.
# text = Sometimes back, Paul told George in the Apple offices that the new generations are a bundle of idiots and useless people, but in any way they would have also been slaves of the Beatles.
# text = The Jewish marriage living to the right of George's house said that he is an arrogant person who does never return a greeting.
# text = The newly married couple living on the corner in front of the entrance of George's house (Friar Park) refers to him as an overbearing person to stay away from.
# text = The receptionist of "Hand made", the former film making company of George Harrison said: "we don't have any relation with that man anymore and we don't want to know anything about him".
# text = It is interesting to note that this company was made bankrupt by the British cinema industry due to the despotism and pedantry of George Harrison, who believed that the cinema industry would have worshiped him.
# text = Their chauvinisms got to the point that even they themselves hated each other.
# text = Paul McCartney said that George Harrison is a nothing.
# text = George Harrison said that he is tired of listening to people talk about John Lennon....
# text = George Harrison said in a video that "Oasis is a very untalented band and they shouldn't be playing at all", all of it being the truth, but the Beatles is also a band of very poor musicians, if musicians at all, who could only play a couple of elementary guitar chords and who are as untalented as Oasis.
# text = The Beatles of the times of the "Cavern" sounded exactly as poorly as Oasis and the little musical quality in the songs of the Beatles is due to George Martin.
# text = Without George Martin the Beatles would have been just another untalented band as Oasis....
# text = Paul McCartney said recently that he believes in using magic, and he does lots of charity, thinking that in this way he will compensate for the CURSE OF GOD that is upon him and that took his wife's life because of his Satanism and involvement in black magic.
# text = He thinks he will deceive people in this way, so that the real McCartney will not be perceived.
# text = Is the old Devil attempting to disguise as good in front of people.
# text = Satan deceiving mankind once again, as so many other thousands of times through the centuries....
# text = The fact that bad apprentice musicians such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones achieved such a giant fame that not even the real quality musicians could achieve, was because the forces of Satan were behind everything, supporting the process.
# text = If you wonder why there is misery and curse in your house, it is because you own some L.P, CD or another article related to the CURSED BY GOD Beatles and Rolling Stones.
# text = We recommend you to take that curse out of your house throwing away everything related to the Devil's main nine puppets....

# text = Attack on Iran: A Looming Folly
# text = By William Rivers Pitt
# text = Monday 09 January 2006
# text = The wires have been humming since before the New Year with reports that the Bush administration is planning an attack on Iran.
# text = "The Bush administration is preparing its NATO allies for a possible military strike against suspected nuclear sites in Iran in the New Year, according to German media reports, reinforcing similar earlier suggestions in the Turkish media," reported UPI on December 30th.
# text = "The Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel this week," continued UPI, "quoted 'NATO intelligence sources' who claimed that the NATO allies had been informed that the United States is currently investigating all possibilities of bringing the mullah-led regime into line, including military options.
# text = This 'all options are open' line has been President George W Bush's publicly stated policy throughout the past 18 months."
# text = An examination of the ramifications of such an attack is desperately in order.
# text = 1.  Blowback in Iraq
# text = The recent elections in Iraq were dominated by an amalgam of religiously fundamentalist Shi'ite organizations, principally the Dawa Party and the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI).
# text = Both Dawa and SCIRI have umbilical connections to the fundamentalist Shi'ite leadership in Iran that go back decades.
# text = In essence, Iran now owns a significant portion of the Iraqi government.
# text = Should the United States undertake military action against Iran, the ramifications in Iraq would be immediate and extreme.
# text = In the first eight days of January, eighteen US troops have been killed in Iraq, compounded by another twelve deaths from a Black Hawk helicopter crash on Saturday.
# text = Much of the violence aimed at American forces is coming from disgruntled Sunni factions that have their own militias, believe the last elections were a sham, and hold little political power in the government.
# text = If the US attacks Iran, it is probable that American forces - already taxed by attacks from Sunni factions - will also face reprisal attacks in Iraq from Shi'ite factions loyal to Iran.
# text = The result will be a dramatic escalation in US and civilian casualties, US forces will be required to bunker themselves further into their bases, and US forces will find themselves required to fight the very government they just finished helping into power.
# text = Iraq, already a seething cauldron, will sink further into chaos.
# text = 2.  Iran's Armaments
# text = Unlike Iraq, Iran has not spent the last fifteen years having its conventional forces worn down by grueling sanctions, repeated attacks, and two American-led wars.
# text = While Iran's conventional army is not what it was during the heyday of the Iran-Iraq war - their armaments have deteriorated and the veterans of that last war have retired - the nation enjoys substantial military strength nonetheless.
# text = According to a report issued by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in December of 2004, Iran "has some 540,000 men under arms and over 350,000 reserves.
# text = They include 120,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards trained for land and naval asymmetrical warfare.
# text = Iran's military also includes holdings of 1,613 main battle tanks, 21,600 other armored fighting vehicles, 3,200 artillery weapons, 306 combat aircraft, 60 attack helicopters, 3 submarines, 59 surface combatants, and 10 amphibious ships."
# text = "Iran is now the only regional military power that poses a significant conventional military threat to Gulf stability," continued the CSIS report.
# text = "Iran has significant capabilities for asymmetric warfare, and poses the additional threat of proliferation.
# text = There is considerable evidence that it is developing both a long-range missile force and a range of weapons of mass destruction.
# text = It has never properly declared its holdings of chemical weapons, and the status of its biological weapons programs is unknown."
# text = A MILNET brief issued in February 2005 reports, "Due to its position astride the Persian Gulf, Iran has constantly been a threat to the Gulf.
# text = The so called 'Tanker' wars in the late 1980s put Iran squarely in the bullseye of all nations seeking to transport oil out of the region.
# text = Even the small navy that Iran puts to sea is capable enough to harass shipping, and several cases of small boat operations against oil well heads in the Gulf during that period made it clear small asymmetrical tactics of the Iranian Navy could be quite effective."
# text = "More concerning," continued the MILNET brief, "is the priority placed on expanding and modernizing its Navy.
# text = The CSIS report cites numerous areas where Iran has funded modernization including the most troublesome aspect, anti-shipping cruise missiles: 'Iran has obtained new anti-ship missiles and missile patrol craft from China, midget submarines from North Korea, submarines from Russia, and modern mines.'"
# text = It is Iran's missile armaments that pose the greatest concern for American forces in the Gulf, especially for the US Navy.
# text = Iran's coast facing the Persian Gulf is a looming wall of mountains that look down upon any naval forces arrayed in those waters.
# text = The Gulf itself only has one exit, the Strait of Hormuz, which is also dominated by the mountainous Iranian coastline.
# text = In essence, Iran holds the high ground in the Gulf.
# text = Missile batteries arrayed in those mountains could raise bloody havoc with any fleet deployed below.
# text = Of all the missiles in Iran's armament, the most dangerous is the Russian-made SS-N-22 Sunburn.
# text = These missiles are, simply, the fastest anti-ship weapons on the planet.
# text = The Sunburn can reach Mach 3 at high altitude.
# text = Its maximum low-altitude speed is Mach 2.2, some three times faster than the American-made Harpoon.
# text = The Sunburn takes two short minutes to cover its full range.
# text = The missile's manufacturers state that one or two missiles could cripple a destroyer, and five missiles could sink a 20,000 ton ship.
# text = The Sunburn is also superior to the Exocet missile.
# text = Recall that it was two Exocets that ripped the USS Stark to shreds in 1987, killing 37 sailors.
# text = The Stark could not see them to stop them.
# text = The US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt is currently deployed in the Persian Gulf, with some 7,000 souls aboard.
# text = Sailing with the Roosevelt is the Tarawa Expeditionary Strike Force, which includes the USS Tarawa, the USS Austin, and the USS Pearl Harbor.
# text = The USS Austin is likewise deployed in the Gulf.
# text = The Sunburn missile, with its incredible speed and ability to avoid radar detection, would do terrible damage these ships if Iran chooses to retaliate in the Gulf after an American attack within its borders.
# text = Beyond the naval threat is the possibility of Iran throwing its military muscle into the ongoing struggle in Iraq.
# text = Currently, the US is facing an asymmetrical attack from groups wielding small arms, shoulder-fired grenades and roadside bombs.
# text = The vaunted American military has suffered 2,210 deaths and tens of thousands of wounded from this form of warfare.
# text = The occupation of Iraq has become a guerrilla war, a siege that has lasted more than a thousand days.
# text = If Iran decides to throw any or all of its 23,000 armored fighting vehicles, along with any or all of its nearly million-strong army, into the Iraq fray, the situation in the Middle East could become unspeakably dire.
# text = 3.  The Syrian Connection
# text = In February of 2005, Iran and Syria agreed upon a mutual protection pact to combat "challenges and threats" in the region.
# text = This was a specific reaction to the American invasion of Iraq, and a reaction to America's condemnation of Syria after the death of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, which was widely seen as an assassination ordered from Damascus.
# text = An attack on Iran would trigger this mutual defense pact, and could conceivably bring Syria into direct conflict with American forces.
# text = Like Iran, Syria's military is nothing to scoff at.
# text = Virtually every credible analysis has Syria standing as the strongest military force in the Middle East after Israel.
# text = Damascus has been intent for years upon establishing significant military strength to serve as a counterweight to Israel's overwhelming capabilities.
# text = As of 2002, Syria had some 215,000 soldiers under arms, 4,700 tanks, and a massive artillery capability.
# text = The Syrian Air Force is comprised of ten to eleven fighter/attack squadrons and sixteen fighter squadrons, totaling somewhere near 650 aircraft.
# text = Syria also possesses one of the largest arsenals of ballistic missiles in the region, comprised primarily of SCUD-derived systems.
# text = Iran, North Korea and China have been willing providers of state-of-the-art technologies.
# text = Compounding this is the well-based suspicion that Syria has perhaps the most advanced chemical weapons capability in the Persian Gulf.
# text = 4.  China and the US Economy
# text = While the ominous possibilities of heightened Iraqi chaos, missiles in the Gulf, and Syrian involvement loom large if the US attacks Iran, all pale in comparison to the involvement of China in any US/Iran engagement.
# text = China's economy is exploding, hampered only by their great thirst for petroleum and natural gas to fuel their industry.
# text = In the last several months, China has inked deals with Iran for $70 billion dollars worth of Iranian oil and natural gas.
# text = China will purchase 250 million tons of liquefied natural gas from Iran over the next 30 years, will develop the massive Yadavaran oil field in Iran, and will receive 150,000 barrels of oil per day from that field.
# text = China is seeking the construction of a pipeline from Iran to the Caspian Sea, where it would link with another planned pipeline running from Kazakhstan to China.
# text = Any US attack on Iran could be perceived by China as a direct threat to its economic health.
# text = Further, any fighting in the Persian Gulf would imperil the tankers running China's liquefied natural gas through the Strait of Hormuz.
# text = Should China decide to retaliate against the US to defend its oil and natural gas deal with Iran, the US would be faced with a significant threat.
# text = This threat exists not merely on a military level, though China could force a confrontation in the Pacific by way of Taiwan.
# text = More significantly, China holds a large portion of the American economy in the palm of its hand.
# text = Paul Craig Roberts, writing for The American Conservative, said in July of 2005 that "As a result of many years of persistent trade surpluses with the United States, the Japanese government holds dollar reserves of approximately $1 trillion.
# text = China's accumulation of dollars is approximately $600 billion.
# text = South Korea holds about $200 billion.
# text = These sums give these countries enormous leverage over the United States.
# text = By dumping some portion of their reserves, these countries could put the dollar under intense pressure and send U.S. interest rates skyrocketing.
# text = Washington would really have to anger Japan and Korea to provoke such action, but in a showdown with China - over Taiwan, for example - China holds the cards.
# text = China and Japan, and the world at large, have more dollar reserves than they require.
# text = They would have no problem teaching a hegemonic superpower a lesson if the need arose."
# text = "The hardest blow on Americans," concluded Roberts, "will fall when China does revalue its currency.
# text = When China's currency ceases to be undervalued, American shoppers in Wal-Mart, where 70 percent of the goods on the shelves are made in China, will think they are in Neiman Marcus.
# text = Price increases will cause a dramatic reduction in American real incomes.
# text = If this coincides with rising interest rates and a setback in the housing market, American consumers will experience the hardest times since the Great Depression."
# text = In short, China has the American economy by the throat.
# text = Should they decide to squeeze, we will all feel it.
# text = China's strong hand in this even extends to the diplomatic realm; China is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and could veto any actions against Iran proposed by the United States.
# text = 5.  American Preparedness
# text = American citizens have for decades taken it as a given that our military can overwhelm and overcome any foe on the battlefield.
# text = The rapid victory during the first Gulf War cemented this perception.
# text = The last three years of the Iraq occupation, however, have sapped this confidence.
# text = Worse, the occupation has done great damage to the strength of the American military, justifying the decrease in confidence.
# text = Thanks to repeated deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, recruiting is at an all-time low.
# text = Soldiers with vital training and know-how are refusing to re-enlist.
# text = Across the board, the American military is stretched to the breaking point.
# text = Two vaunted economists - one a Nobel Prize winner and the other a nationally renowned budget expert - have analyzed the data at hand and put a price tag on the Iraq occupation.
# text = According to Linda Bilmes of Harvard and Nobel Laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz of Columbia University, the final cost of the Iraq occupation will run between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, surpassing by orders of magnitude the estimates put forth by the Bush administration.
# text = If an engagement with Iran envelops our forces in Iraq, and comes to involve Syria, our economy will likely shatter under the strain of fighting so many countries simultaneously.
# text = Add to this the economic threat posed by China, and the economic threat implicit in any substantial disruption of the distribution of Mideast petroleum to the globe.
# text = If Iran and Syria - with their significant armaments, missile technologies and suspected chemical weapons capabilities - decide to engage with the relatively undersized US force in Iraq, our troops there will be fish in a barrel.
# text = Iran's position over the Gulf would make resupply by ship and air support from carriers a dangerous affair.
# text = In the worst-case scenario, the newly-minted American order of battle requiring the use of nuclear weapons to rescue a surrounded and imperiled force could come into play, hurling the entire planet into military and diplomatic bedlam.
# text = Conclusion: Is Any of This Possible?
# text = The question must be put as directly as possible: what manner of maniac would undertake a path so fraught with peril and potential economic catastrophe?
# text = It is difficult to imagine a justification for any action that could envelop the United States in a military and economic conflict with Iraq, Iran, Syria and China simultaneously.
# text = Iran is suspected by many nations of working towards the development of nuclear weapons, but even this justification has been tossed into a cocked hat.
# text = Recently, Russian president Vladimir Putin bluntly stated that Iran is not developing its nuclear capability for any reasons beyond peaceful energy creation, and pledged to continue assisting Iran in this endeavor.
# text = Therefore, any attack upon Iran's nuclear facilities will bring Russia into the mess.
# text = Iran also stands accused of aiding terrorism across the globe.
# text = The dangers implicit in any attack upon that nation, however, seem to significantly offset whatever gains could be made in the so-called "War on Terror."
# text = Unfortunately, all the dangers in the world are no match for the self-assurance of a bubble-encased zealot.
# text = What manner of maniac would undertake such a dangerous course?
# text = Look no further than 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
# text = George W. Bush and his administration have consistently undertaken incredibly dangerous courses of action in order to garner political power on the home front.
# text = Recall the multiple terror threats lobbed out by the administration whenever damaging political news appeared in the media.
# text = More significantly, recall Iraq.
# text = Karl Rove, Bush's most senior advisor, notoriously told Republicans on the ballot during the 2002 midterms to "run on the war."
# text = The invasion of Iraq provided marvelous political cover for the GOP not only during those midterms, but during the 2004 Presidential election.
# text = What kind of political cover would be gained from an attack on Iran, and from the diversion of attention to that attack?
# text = The answer lies in one now-familiar name: Jack Abramoff.
# text = The Abramoff scandal threatens to subsume all the hard-fought GOP gains in Congress, and the 2006 midterms are less than a year away.
# text = Is any of this a probability?
# text = Logic says no, but logic seldom plays any part in modern American politics.
# text = All arguments that the Bush administration would be insane to attack Iran and risk a global conflagration for the sake of political cover run into one unavoidable truth.
# text = They did it once already in Iraq.

# text = 1 - Number of paragraphs devoted to global warming in the EPA's 600-page "Draft Report on the Environment" presented in 2003.
# text = 68 - Number of days after taking office that Bush decided Not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the international treaty to reduce greenhouse gases by roughly 5.2 per cent below 1990 levels by 2012.

# text = 25 - Percentage of overall worldwide carbon dioxide emissions the United States is responsible for.
# text = 53 - Number of days after taking office that Bush reneged on his campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.
# text = 14 - Percentage carbon dioxide emissions will increase over the next 10 years under Bush's own global-warming plan (an increase of 30 per cent above their 1990 levels).

# text = or it is normal?
# text = Are you sure it isn't dirt on the sensor?
# text = Put the camera on manual focus and set focus to infinity
# text = You will see in the image if there is dirt as that will be the only thing in focus
# text = Cure is to get the sensor cleaned
# text = There should be a Pixel Mapping function in the menu that will get rid of them, most sensors have a few dead and flipped pixels, some only show up on long exposures.

# text = New Zealand skilled migrant visa?
# text = If you apply for a skilled migrant workers visa and it is accepted do you have to find work in the same sector as your skills on your application or can you take up other work if you can't find something in your own field.
# text = I have posted this question on the NZ visa site and can't get any info, does anyone know.???
# text = Watch out the poles are coming.....my little butterfly
# text = That would be preferable but it doesn't matter, could be something similar
# text = It depends on the conditions of your skilled migrant visa.
# text = Your visa should say whether or not you are restricted to work in a specific sector.
# text = If your visa does not restrict you from taking any work in New Zealand then you can work in any sector.
# text = It only matters if you received an offer of employment or if you are currently working in New Zealand and used that job in your application to get your skilled migrant visa.
# text = In Chicago, what is the best restaurant to dine at on a budget?
# text = Downtown Chicago, Loop, North
# text = Take the red line to Clark, then you turn right.
# text = Walk 2 blocks then turn right again.
# text = Walk 2 more blocks then cross the street.
# text = You will get to a place called "BIG BOWL".
# text = THAI FOOD AND ASIAN.
# text = BEST PLACE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!
# text = McDonalds
# text = Not necessarily the restaurant but what you order when you get there and what time you go.
# text = A lunch will be less expensive than a dinner.
# text = You can order appetizers rather than a full meal and have just as good a dinner.
# text = But the best way is to use coupons.
# text = Check out http://www.restaurant.com lots of restaurants you can look at the menu and check out prices.
# text = Yo also may want to try "small neighborhood" restaurants and support family run places rather than the large corporate chains.
# text = Not that there is anything wrong with that because they also employ local people that live and shop in the area.
# text = Is there any cure for mouse poison?
# text = I found a poor little mouse walking around in my friends house, and since I was able to catch it very easily (normally mice move at the speed of light), and since it was acting unresponsive, I thought it was infected with mouse poison, since my friend uses it.
# text = I know that the mouse will probably die, but I was wondering if there is any cure for mouse poison?
# text = I just hate to see the poor dears experience a slow painful death that way :( .
# text = Without knowing the exact poison, no.
# text = A common one is arsenic and there really isn't a way to cure that.
# text = Take the mouse to an emergency vet and have them use CO2 to put the mouse to sleep.
# text = Or, you can put the animal in a snap trap designed for rats or mice since that is the only really humane kill method for invasive animals.
# text = A quick cure would be Arm & Hammer to it's head.
# text = Crayola Air- Dry Clay?
# text = Ok.
# text = So I have a VERY long list of people I want to make Xmas gifts for and one of them is my best friend.
# text = She loves giraffes and homemade things!
# text = I am very artistic so I decided I was going to make her a giraffe sculpture.
# text = I don't have much money so I bought Crayola Air-Dry Clay.
# text = I have sculpted the giraffe laying down.
# text = The key is...I have a few problems:
# text = 1. I tested it out by making a figure boat
# text = And after 4 days when it dried it was very fragile!
# text = (like VERY not in a good way)
# text = Is there any way to strengthen it?
# text = 2. What kind of paint do I use to paint the giraffe?
# text = 3. Is there any cheap way to give it a shine like I made it in a kiln?
# text = air dry clay works on armatures , the clay has a minor shrink percent, so you can leave the wire armature inside, paint with acrylic paint
# text = taking young cat with me for a week out of state?
# text = good idea?
# text = i have a 3-4 month old kitten and i live in forida.
# text = i am going to my grandmas in north carolina and we are going camping in a cabin in west virginia.
# text = My cat is a outside cat but she loves it inside.
# text = she is also good in a carrier.
# text = Should i bring her?
# text = if so how quick will she adapt to a litter box inside?
# text = thanks
# text = We took our cat Mitten camping.
# text = He loved it.
# text = But he was an inside/outside cat (only one I owned - rest have been 100 0nside cats).
# text = He was trained to a harness/leash for outside time but he knew to use the litter pan inside.
# text = If your cat is not trained to use the litter pan, you may have a problem taking her.
# text = NO!
# text = changing its surroundings too often will stress it out and it will get depressed, mean, sick, or will not want to be around you.
# text = What cleaners should I use for dusting around my parakeet?
# text = What cleaners can I use to dust around my budgie.
# text = Would pledge be ok?
# text = If not, what is?
# text = Your best bet would just be a swiffer duster -- they don't require cleaner.
# text = If you must use a cleaner, pledge should be fine if the area that you keep your parakeet in is well ventilated.
# text = I have had parakeets for a VERY long time, and I use pledge.
# text = Just keep a window open for a while for fresh air to circulate.
# text = I agree w the answer from Nothing.
# text = Even a cotton cloth (I like diapers) that is barely damp w water will work fine.
# text = Swiffer or any type of micro-fiber cloth is excellent.
# text = I use Miracle Cloth, they're fantastic, just don't use fabric softener or dryer sheets when cleaning them, it ruins their "grabbing" ability.
# text = http://www.solutions.com/jump.jsp?itemID=1361&itemType=PRODUCT&path=1%2C3%2C477&iProductID=1361 If anything you use has a strong or lingering fragrance it can bother or potentially injure the bird.
# text = RP: Is it wrong to want to remove a contact because they are really really stupid...?

# text = Its not any of you lol
# text = i emailed you saaaaaam.
# text = I don't know.
# text = how did you know.
# text = it's not me is it!?

# text = iguzwhat lol
# text = whoooooo?
# text = sorry but i can't help my stupidity =(
# text = EDIT: I love how she says it's not callum but doesn't deny it's me....i think we all know who she's talking about...
# text = EDIT: now i'm curious...
# text = EDIT: How did I know...
# text = lol they really aren't that much worse than me
# text = and their gpa was better than mine....
# text = can i buy a laptop in u.k and then take it to rep.ireland and put a irish pay,go dongle init?
# text = i want to buy a laptop for my girlfriend in ireland,would she be able to just use the dongle she uses for her pc and put it straight in the laptop and it work like normall?
# text = thanks people
# text = Yes obviously the USB is region free which means you can use it anywhere.
# text = And every computer manufactured in both Ireland & the UK are Region 2 aka PAL.
# text = There won't be a difference since mobile broadband is supposed to be digital.
# text = But word of advice if you're get your girlfriend a laptop make sure its a good brand a not something like DELL, Acer, Asus, eMachines etc.
# text = just a heads up.
# text = yes of course you can....
# text = I have many friends that have laptops bought in the UK that use them here
# text = How do I take care of my newborn baby fish?
# text = I am nervous that my other fish will eat them, and I don't know what to feed them!
# text = I have counted around 25 of them and they currently reside in a 20 gallon tank.
# text = You could move all the babies into a fry net breeder or move all of the bigger fish (also the parents) to a different tank to avoid the babies getting eaten.
# text = Feed the babies 3-4 times a day with flakes.
# text = Provide plenty of hiding places like rocks, plants, etc in the tank.
# text = Its natural for some babies to be eaten by adults and if all of them survived your tank would be very overcrowded.
# text = Look in the pet stores for "fry food" or "baby fish foods".
# text = what kind of newborn fish you have?
# text = some parents would not eat there fish till a certain age jack dempsey for example would not eat there offspring till they mature but i would move the baby fish into a smaller tank and feed them flakes
# text = I have a question about McDonald's Monopoly!

# text = bearded dragon spikes?
# text = bit of a stupid question but do the spikes/spines (whatever you call them) on their side and face area ever go hard.
# text = or are they just supposed to look like they are so nothing will try to eat them
# text = becca is right .
# text = iv owned beardies for ovr 3 yrs and i handle mine all the time.. they dont go hard lik eneedle hard but they arnt pillow soft.
# text = they use them to look prickly.. would you try to eat a cactus [if u had no knife] i know i wouldnt.
# text = they puff out to look bigger and badder and they can scratch you a lil if ur holding them to tight :)
# text = Theyre not really hard.
# text = Beardies are actually quite delicate.
# text = I'm assuming it's to scare off predators / like how they will puff up their neck spikes to make them look bigger to predators or enemies.
# text = they dont hurt unless your stupid enough to press on them.
# text = They just are there as an adaptation.
# text = what is a kimberwick bit used for?
# text = Used as a help for horses that are quite strong pullers while hacking, hunting and doing cross country.
# text = It is a curb bit with a ported mouth piece and some horses appreciate this to give them more room in their mouths for their tongues.
# text = It is not as precise as a pelham bit because it only uses one rein, though the modern ones have two or three slots on which to put the reins.
# text = The lower the reins, the stronger the action and the lower the reins the stronger the action on the poll too.
# text = Useful for younger kids who do not have big enough hands or the ability to handle two reins independently.
# text = For horses that are strong pullers.
# text = It just gives you a little leverage and curb pressure.
# text = It's nice for horses that need a little more than a snaffle.
# text = I know that's vague, but it depends on the horse.
# text = The rider needs to have independent hands as well, because you do NOT want to pull too hard on a bit like that. ;)
# text = How long to save up for a canon t3i?
# text = I want to save up for a canon t3i, around 750-800 + :(
# text = I'm currently 12 and I get about 20 dollars a week for lunch, sometimes a bit more, I plan to save 10 dollars every week :)
# text = My birthday is in november and I get about .... 150 or more since i hate my dads family.. haha
# text = Chinese new year ~ 300
# text = christmas ~ 100
# text = and yeaa...
# text = Can someone cunclude how long it might take me to save up for the canan t3i or some extra tips to save/gain money? :O
# text = Hey,
# text = Be happy you get a bit, many of us never got nothing :)
# text = There's a Canon EOS T2i, with the exact same sensor, just no articulating screen.
# text = It's around $100 less, which means you get the same camera but quicker!
# text = Here's a DSLR Buying Guide - http://www.the-dslr-photographer.com/2009/11/which-dslr-to-buy/
# text = Don't worry about it.

# text = hey kido u made me smile
# text = does the POP drying time slow down if it not exposed to air?
# text = its for a craft project.....i want to use it the way u would use icing....
# text = took a bit of searching to discover that POP is probably PoP - plaster of Paris and yes plaster of Paris will slow way down if it is not exposed to air - in fact, if you are building up plaster ("the way you would icing") to do sculpting, which is rather uncommon, you keep the set plaster damp in order to add more unset plaster or you have to wet the area where you will be adding plaster "mud"
# text = Plaster of Paris does two things
# text = - it chemically sets - gets warm to hot then cools down and hard and
# text = - it dries out, losing the water that is soaked into the set structure
# text = For example, a set plaster mold that is to be used for clay slip casting must be dry - it gets wet pulling the water out of the slip - while a set plaster mold used for molding wax must be soaking or damp wet http://www.mikegigi.com/castgobl.htm#LGGOBPROJ
# text = Dwarf Hamster Making Too Much Noise On Wheel at Night?
# text = I'm getting a dwarf Hamster tomorrow And i was just talking to my Mom and she said that we have to take out the wheel at night because it would disturb her sleep But i told her no because i said their energetic at night at my room is right next door to hers But i heard their are wheels that dont make noise at all what would be the price of it?
# text = I'm quite sure , you don't even have to buy another , all you need to do , is to pour some oil on the wheel , or even put some rubber on it's edges , the part that is making the noise .
# text = That might work
# text = Super Pet Silent Spinner Exercise Wheel
# text = Our Price: $10.99 to 12.99 PETSMART!
# text = works well lasts long.
# text = I have a dwarf hamster who HATES his wheel and doesn't use it -
# text = he makes so much MORE noise, as he plays and digs and jumps (seriously)
# text = wheels are relatively noiseless -
# text = a few squeaks from a wheel are better than the full wrath of a bored pet!
# text = Change of boarding station?
# text = How can I change my boarding station against the ticket I booked a month back from counter?
# text = My origin Station is Howrah, but I want to board at Asansol..
# text = Does your train pass Asansol when starting from Howrah?
# text = If yes, you don't need to change it because you board later.
# text = If no, you'll have to go to one of the train stations.
# text = In Calcutta there is a Foreigner's reservation office where they speak English very well.
# text = I don't remember near which station it is though.
# text = They can help you and it is close to a train station in Calcutta so check a few big ones?
# text = Even if you don't find the foreigner's office you'll be fine in the normal Reservation Office of any big train station.
# text = This is where you can get AND change express train tickets.
# text = well if your desired boarding station comes after more than 2 or 3 halts of the actual boarding point, then the TC will cancel you ticket and allot the seat to others.
# text = so better inquire in railway office
# text = Contact the Indian railways.
# text = You might end up as a no show passenger.
# text = petsmart application?
# text = my name is Josalyn Leainne Creek and i'm 19 years old and i graduated from high in May adn of this year and i love animals and i'm great at working and i had drama in my last job which was mcallister's deli and i', a mormon and i hvae changed to be a better person that pwople are wanting to hirier and i'm willing to work whenever you need me but i go to church on every sunday and i have a doctor's appointment this thursday at 2;30 and i hope you h=guys hirier me because i work very hard and i dont care about how much you guys pay and i've been looking for a job ever since i have graduated and i hate drama
# text = Jeez, work on your spelling and punctuation.
# text = It makes a huge difference.
# text = No one's going to hire you if you can't even spell, especially if you're a high school graduate.
# text = Cover letters and resumes need to be perfect.
# text = No one's going to take you seriously if they're full of typos and whatnot.
# text = Sorry, I would put that application in the round file.
# text = Nope
# text = Canadian student visa, can I used for other schools?
# text = I applied to get a student visa to study in Canada, I received one that is valid until October of 2015.
# text = Problem is, for some reason, the visa process took longer than it should, thus I missed school this semester (visa was issued to me about 25 days after school started so I couldn't attend), now I no longer want to go into that school (because they only would accept me again on September of 2012), I found a school that accepted me for may 2012, can I use the same visa that was issued to me?
# text = or do I need to reapply ?
# text = (in the visa itself, it does not mention anything about which school I m suppose to attend, and problem is, the embassy here in DC are not too nice and would never answer ANY questions....) any advice please?
# text = Visas and Study Permits are administered by Citizenship and Immigration Canada, and any questions regarding applications should be directed to them.
# text = So best advice is to go to the C&IC website and click "contact us" - http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/index.asp
# text = How Do you Prevent A Dwarf Hamster Escaping From The Cage?
# text = Im getting a dwarf hamster tomorrow and i saw videos on youtube of them escaping and if my hamster escaped because my mom will FREAK OUT!!!
# text = would it help getting an aquarium cage or a plastic see through box so it cant escape i can buy it a wheel
# text = I've never had a dwarf hamster but I've had the same problem with my pet rat I put some chicken wiring around it the I got from home depot and now it can't out.
# text = Yes I've had 53 different kinds of rodents and two were dwarf hamsters they flatten into a pancake and slide right through the bars and are able to open the door so yes a plastic cage will be good
# text = Hi
# text = This is the cage I have whhich is pretty much IMPOSSIBLE to escape from:
# text = http://www.petsathome.com/shop/combi-1-dwarf-hamster-cage-by-ferplast-15986
# text = I love this cage, it's easy to clean, very spacious and fun for the hamster
# text = Aquiriums are good also, but provide a mesh top for an easy airway.
# text = Wire cages are NOT acceptable for dwarfs really, unless the bars have less than half a cm between them.
# text = regards and have fun with your hammy
# text = Rachel
# text = Travelers guide - For the young and unknowledgeable?
# text = I am 17 years old.
# text = I do not get along with my family.
# text = I dislike this urban society and want to leave this whole enviroment.
# text = I am very unhappy here.
# text = I don't know the best way of doing it.
# text = Would it be best for me to finish college?
# text = wait for 18th birthday?
# text = I live in London.
# text = I want to go travelling.
# text = My parents do not like me, They constantly reassure me that they will throw me out of home when I turn 18.
# text = I don't particularly want to stay with them atm either.
# text = But right now its the most convenient thing to do.
# text = Anyway Advice for travelling.
# text = What is the best way of doing it?
# text = Hotels for travelling will be expensive.
# text = anybody is open to answers but I would much prefere somebody with traveling experience.
# text = I want to go all over :) I don't have a set route yet.
# text = Get a back pack and sleeping bag or good warm blanket.
# text = Wool is best.
# text = Light ,warm, but also itchy.
# text = Hit the road.
# text = You can always beg for spare change when you get hungry.
# text = Should get some survival skills before setting out on your own.
# text = Vietnamese girl's name, Mayko?
# text = I always thought Mayko or Meiko is a Japanese name.
# text = The Canadian Regenesis actress Mayko Nguyen has Japanese connection or is it her fake name?
# text = Right, I couldn't find any proven source for that.
# text = And her last name, Nguyen is a typical Vietnamese family name...anyone?
# text = Certainly, Nguyen is the one of first names of many people in Vietnam, only in Vietnam.
# text = Mayko is relating to the Japanese.
# text = In Vietnam, when a baby was born, they must be named "first name" according to that of their fathers.
# text = It's principle except a number of cases, for example, the babies are orphans or not to have father.
# text = E.g.
# text = Full name of the father is: "Nguyen Thanh Luan" ===> Full name of the son/daughter certainly is " Nguyen..........", for instance, "Nguyen Thi Thuy Lan".
# text = But if the babies were born in American so they would named in other way but still remain "First name" in order to recall about their origination.
# text = I'm pretty sure that Mayko is Japanese.
# text = She is a Canadian born Vietnamese.
# text = I'm not sure where her first name is from...
# text = I have a splitter/filter between my ADSL and ph line?
# text = I have 2 phones running on the same line and the ADSL which is connected to one of the phones and the filter, I'm still getting a buzzing noise even when I have disconnected the other phone without one.
# text = Why is it stil doing this even though I don't have the other phone connected?
# text = Woud it be better if I got another filter and connected the other phone as well?
# text = turn the modem off and see if the sound is still there... could be static on the line... if the sound is still there with the modem off then the problem is NOT the DSL....
# text = if the trouble goes away with the modem off, then make sure that EVERYTHING EXCEPT the modem is filtered, this would include the alarm system, fax machine, satellite boxes, phones, etc...
# text = if everything is filtered, and you still have this problem - try changing the filter - if it is still there, try doubling up on the filters...
# text = You need either a filter for each device except the DSL modem, or a whole home filter which filters all the jacks, except the one which the DSL modem connects.
# text = Best way to change 35mm film in Holga 120 whilst out and about?
# text = I've modified my Holga 120 to take 35mm film and I know that you can't wind the film back, you have to open the back of the camera (in a darkroom) to rewind the film.
# text = What do other Holga owners do when they need to change film when they are traveling?
# text = Do you just take a changing bag with you?
# text = Whats the easiest thing?
# text = Well a changing bag would be the easiest solution.
# text = It's light proof and makes sure you get no problems when opening the camera.
# text = You can work comfortably and make sure your film is not scratched etc.
# text = It's really difficult to find a place that is absolutely dark and accessible to you when you're outside.
# text = A changing bag folds neatly and does not take much space in your bag.
# text = A film changing bag is a handy way of unloading your exposed film in the field.
# text = Many online stores carry them, like Adorama:
# text = http://www.adorama.com/BLCBS.html
# text = I have a few how to videos for DIY 35mm film in a 120 camera on my YouTube channel:

# text = I'ma sophomore in highschool doing a presentation on Italian Arts and my teacher is making us censor the Statue of David.
# text = My argument is it's art and therefore should not be censored he's making us censor it who's right
# text = no,it's only a body of a young man
# text = the city of florence did at one time in the past put clothes on the statue
# text = An art teacher in the mid-cities area of Dallas/Ft.Worth metro got fired because she took an art class on an approved field trip with parental permission for each student and some hysterical parent discovered that they saw "nudes" in the museum.
# text = You don't think is was because of female nudes considering the nearly naked girls/women seen at pools and beaches and the completely naked manikins that show up in store windows in malls during changes in display?
# text = No, it was guys.
# text = Your teacher knows what goes on in your community and wants to keep her job.
# text = Let her do it - argue when you are of age and can battle the other adults in your community - skipping of course telling your boss he/she is a prudish ignoramus because you want to keep your job.
# text = Better Steakhouse in Philadelphia?
# text = I am taking my wife out for our first year wedding anniversary and we both agree that we want a good steak.
# text = We are staying at a hotel in Center City Philadelphia so I wanted something close.

# text = I have also looked at the photo galleries for an inside look at the decor of the restaurants and I have narrowed it down to three establishments.
# text = I have never been to any of these places so any suggestions and or advice would be most welcome.
# text = It's narrowed down to Butcher and Singer, Davio's, and Del Friscos.
# text = Thanks in advance for the advice.
# text = Sidenote... I am familiar with the Capital Grille, Barclay Prime, The Palm, The Prime Rib, Mortons, Ruth Chris', etc.
# text = I have weighed those options and found the three that I have chosen to be more my wife and my own taste.
# text = Please only reviews on the three I mentioned earlier.
# text = Many thanks.
# text = I am only familiar with Morton's and Ruth Chris.
# text = I have never eaten at the ones you have listed nor do I know of anyone who has.
# text = I hope you get your answer.
# text = Anyway, have a lovely first anniversary!
# text = HAMSTERS - will a hamster be ok living in the bathroom ?
# text = in his cage in the bathroom ?
# text = or would the steam from the shower be a problem ?
# text = thanks d
# text = If space is minimal, or you are keeping him in there to be kept away from other pets, then I can understand why you would choose to keep him there.
# text = There are some things to consider though...
# text = Rodents require special bedding in their cages to absorb their waste, and this needs to be cleaned regularly, or your hamster could suffer from problems due the buildup of ammonia from his urine.
# text = When you take a warm shower and build up steam, his cage will collect water, the bedding will absorb much of it, and will not be able to absorb the urine quite as it should.
# text = You will also have to be wary of mold forming on any toys or hide-aways he may have.
# text = You also don't want it getting too warm for him too often.
# text = Overall, it is not a good solution, but you can keep him healthy and pull it off if you take the time to give him the extra care he will need because of it.
# text = It may be a problem because the temperature is constantly changing.
# text = I would personally put him somewhere else.
# text = What is the most interesting place to see in South Korea?
# text = I'm planning my trip to Asia and S.Korea is one of the destinations.
# text = What place or town would be most interesting to visit for european?
# text = Go to Jeju island!
# text = It's so much fun over there, and I'm positive that you'll love it! :)
# text = If you're going to Seoul, then you should also visit a specific place called, 'The Namsan Tower'!
# text = It's a really huge place over there, and so many visitors/foreigners went to put chains and locks over there!
# text = It's so much fun!
# text = Also, don't forget to try out Korea's famous amusement parks!: Lotte World, Everland, and Carribbean Bay!
# text = Everyone loves it! ^_^
# text = Lotte World: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X_e2uwT6wPw/Tkj_7UVTw6I/AAAAAAAAAGs/e_hICAdYPYI/s1600/lotte_world_from_high_up.jpg

# text = Have fun in Korea~
# text = an island called jejudo/jeju island
# text = its really amazing there, itll blow your mind
# text = it's almost like paradise there
# text = I found an injured pure white bird (dove I guess?)
# text = what do I feed it?
# text = I found this pure white bird in my neighborhood, its wing is injured, so I'm currently taking care of it.
# text = It's pure white, no marks or streaks or anything, I don't know what type of bird it is, probably a dove?
# text = What should I feed it?
# text = Is normal bird food fine?
# text = (Because apparently my mom is very picky, she says the bird might get sick if it doesn't eat the right food) IS there any specific food I might find at any pet shop?
# text = (petco, petsmart) ..... thanks!
# text = Doves are a species of pigeon ,they are Seed eaters, they do not eat bread,or worms.
# text = make sure that you have a shallow dish of water for it.
# text = as they can drink a lot.
# text = there's these little like bait worms at jacks.petshoppe .
# text = its jacks aquarium and pets I believe. ?
# text = anyways I feed them to my road sometimes.
# text = like a little container.
# text = or buy small bait worms.
# text = that should work
# text = If you have a pet store near buy some wheat,pigeon corn or even mixed bird seed will do,but do not feed bread.
# text = how do i get to paris cdg airport to paris montparnasse?
# text = i have two options
# text = using the metro or the air france bus
# text = can anybody tell me if the metro runs directly from CDG to montparnasse?
# text = if not what transfers should i get on?
# text = ty
# text = On the RER/Metro:
# text = In the airport, follow the signs that say "Paris by train".
# text = Buy a ticket for Paris.
# text = This will get you on the RER B line going into town.
# text = Stay on it until the "Saint-Michel Notre-Dame" station.
# text = Change there to the Metro 4 line going toward "Porte d'Orleans".
# text = Get off at the "Montparnasse Bienvenue" station.
# text = On the Air France bus:
# text = As I recall, this bus drops you off near the Opera in Paris.
# text = You'll still have to take another bus or the Metro down to Montparnasse.
# text = On the bus: Get on Bus 95 going toward "Porte de Vanves".
# text = Buy a ticket from the driver.
# text = Stay on the bus until the "Montparnasse Bienvenue" stop.
# text = On the Metro: Get in the Metro at Opera.
# text = Take the 8 line toward "Balard" until the "Invalides" station.
# text = Change there to the 13 line toward "Chatillon Montrouge" and take it until the "Montparnasse Bienvenue" station.
# text = What are good B&W software's Photography?
# text = What are really good programs for smooth crisp Black & White editing?
# text = I use GIMP and Its not cutting it, looks terrible.
# text = Here's one of my shots in B&W
# text = http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamtolle/6094960940/in/set-72157627535453128/
# text = Any programs that you use please list :) Thx
# text = You could also try this in gimp.
# text = It will give you a lot more power, as well as control over how your black and white photo looks:
# text = Open your image while it's still in color
# text = Create a new layer and fill the later with black.
# text = Set the layer mode to "color" this will make your image blak and white.
# text = Click colors>>>levels and adjust each channel's color values.
# text = This will adjust the brightness and darkness of specific parts of an image.
# text = For more information on the theory behind later modes check out this gimp video tutorial: http://gimpedblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/gimp-video-tutorial-how-to-convert.html
# text = For more information on adjusting exposure in gimp chef out this gimp video tutorial: http://gimpedblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/how-to-use-gimp-for-beginners-lesson-4.html
# text = Hope this helps.
# text = Picasa is free and pretty good.
# text = But best is obviously photoshop CS5 or if your on a macbook theres aperture :)
# text = depends what you want from "B&W"... many programs will use a generic B&W...
# text = try something like photoscape which has different options...
# text = cheapest plastic surgeons in Thailand?
# text = I want to go to thailand to do my boob job from South Africa but looking for the cheapest surgeons yet also good in his artwork on a humans body .
# text = Only a fool would base a decision using the cheapest surgeon to perform an operation.
# text = Cheapest surgeons work out of some small clinic and do not have the skills you are looking for. .
# text = Do you really want to put your faith in some clinic doctor.
# text = I know I wouldn't.
# text = You need to check with one of the major hospital that performance this procedure like Bumrungard Hospital or Yanhee Hospital.
# text = Would you choose the cheapest brakes for your expensive race car or maybe the cheapest parachute too?
# text = Sometimes the "cheap" comes expensive!
# text = When you have invasive surgery you could also get infections, accidental nicks and cuts that cause other problems too!
# text = If they screw up you could be in worse shape than you are now!
# text = Bumrungrad Hospital does some good work but all hospitals do have their problems from time to time.
# text = Maybe having an experienced doctor might be better than some guy that is cheaper but less experienced!
# text = http://www.bumrungrad.com/en/patient-services/clinics-and-centers/plastic-surgery-thailand-bangkok/breast-augmentation-ba
# text = The cheapest *high quality* plastic surgeons are at Yanhee Hospitals.
# text = They do outstanding work.
# text = Check the link for a sampling of prices.
# text = my Tom cat will not eat meat just the juice in the can.?
# text = When I open a can of meat with gravy he licks off the gravy and lets the meat lay.
# text = I must through it away .
# text = Why?
# text = If you knew what kind of "meat" they put in canned cat food you'd understand this.
# text = I've had a lot of cats who refused to eat the canned food.
# text = When you read the label its easy to understand why.
# text = I've had cats for 35 years and I only feed them dry food.
# text = They have done very well and like the dry food better.
# text = It had better nutritional value and its also less expensive.
# text = Canned food is often suspect as to the actual contents and you're paying for a high moisture content instead of food content.
# text = There are a lot of good quality dry cat foods.
# text = Read the labels for contents.
# text = Your cat will adjust quickly.
# text = You'll also have less spoilage.
# text = He might be sick take him to the vet to see
# text = If he always does this, welcome to the club.
# text = My oldest female and youngest male do this - I just grab the blender and pop in some other stuff for them like chicken liver (cooked) for the anemic one, some arthritis stuff for the oldest.
# text = Even if you mash it with a spoon he can't do that,
# text = Whats your favorite part about trail riding?
# text = I love how it really depends on how good a horse your horse really is, not how talented he is.
# text = If you took some Olympic-level horses on a trail ride, they just couldn't do it.
# text = They would be too scared and spooky.
# text = It doesn't matter how graceful your horse is, or how high he can jump, or how well he does a sliding stop.
# text = What matters is how well trained he is, and how good your bond it.
# text = That is another reason why I like competitive trail riding also.
# text = Nobody pays someone to keep their horse in shape and rides once a week, then takes all the ribbons at the show because their horse is good.
# text = YOU have to spend the time training.
# text = And I have not met one stuck-up trail rider!
# text = Those are just a few reasons why I love trail riding, competitive or not.
# text = Same, when I'm galloping in an open space like that I can just forget everything.
# text = Seeing the nature and wild life that if you keep quiet you can get up close and personal.
# text = I have had several close encounters with both foxes and wild deer.
# text = Also woodpeckers were pecking in the trees and I just sat and watched.
# text = Fascinating.
# text = 10 gallon nano reef ideas?
# text = I have a 10 gallon nano reef with 10 lbs of live fiji rock, and 10 lbs of live carribean sand.
# text = I am aware of the maintenance involved in keeping a tank this size.
# text = I am currently maintaining a gravity level of 1.024.
# text = I have a 10 gallon filter on it.
# text = I also have a powerhead, getting another soon.
# text = I have a few questions, first I want to start a sump filter, but I have no idea on how the water intake and water return would work.
# text = How would I need to set a sump for this 10 gallon?
# text = Do I need a protein skimmer or any other equipment?
# text = thanks
# text = Unless the tank has a built in overflow box (which I'm certain it doesn't) then you have to get one of those hang on back overflow boxes so that you can install a sump.
# text = The piping would lead down into your sump from the overflow box.
# text = On the other end of the sump, you would have a small return pump with a hose that puts the water back into your tank.
# text = If you're going to go through the trouble of creating a sump for this tank, getting a protein skimmer wouldn't be a bad idea.
# text = The Hydor SlimSkim Nano is a good nano protein skimmer, it's an in-tank design that could easily sit in your sump.
# text = NOOK Color or NOOK Tablet?
# text = From what I understand they're pretty much the same thing.
# text = Some of the major differences I see is the HD video, longer battery life, and faster processor that the NOOK Tablet boasts.
# text = Does the Tablet have a major difference in speed compared to the Color?
# text = I don't want an iPad or Kindle.
# text = I just want an e-reader that does a little bit more than just read.
# text = Yes, I know about the Kindle Fire but that's not what I want (: Does it make sense to shell out the extra fifty dollars?
# text = Or just purchase the Color?
# text = Well I recently bought the Nook Color, and I have to say that I am very happy with it.
# text = It is like a mini tablet itself!
# text = When I found out them came up with the Nook Tablet, I was pretty disappointed though, because I bought my Nook color for the same darn price!
# text = So I say you should go for the more updated Nook Tablet.
# text = I'm pretty sure it'll be worth it.
# text = Have fun!
# text = Judging by Nook Tablet's processor it's supposed to be quite faster!
# text = Basically Nook Tablet it has more memory, better battery life and a better processor and a microphone.

# text = Pubs in Philadelphia?
# text = Hey there, I'm trying to find a restaurant in Philly to take my husband tomorrow for his birthday.
# text = He's pretty much an "I love American Food, good drinks on occasion, laid back." kind of guy. ;)
# text = I want to take him somewhere where there's going to be awesome burgers/american food, atmosphere (preferably a tavern/pub style would be nice), good service, and all around a great time. =)
# text = I'm looking for suggestions from anyone who knows the philly area and the where to's.
# text = We just moved to a town outside Philly a couple of months back so I'm not an expert on the area.
# text = A little help is always great. =)
# text = Thank you or your feed back.
# text = Oh my, you asked this question at the perfect time.
# text = Go to a local market or drug store, and buy this month's copy of the "Philadelphia Magazine".
# text = It is all about this very subject ... bars and food.
# text = It lists places all over the city and suburbs.
# text = Wishing your husband a happy birthday!
# text = If you're looking for a good burger, some great fries (they are too die for!), and good drinks, go to Chickie & Pete's!
# text = Oh my gosh, they are great!
# text = If you go, make sure you order the crab fries, you won't regret it :)
# text = How to start a new fish tank?
# text = I'm getting a 10 gallon for my betta tomorrow and I just want to know how to properly set it up.
# text = I'm still a beginner.
# text = Any and all suggestions on what I need to do and buy will help.
# text = Thanks.
# text = When you get the tank make sure you wash the inside (with plain water) then you wash the gravel (with only water too) take out all the stuff that is floating on top.
# text = Add only silk plants as plastic ones may tear up ur bettas delicate fins.
# text = You add the water and put water conditioner into the water.
# text = Start up your filter (sponge filters are the best for bettas) and put in a heater and set it to anywhere between 78-82.
# text = Wait about 2 weeks or 3 and test your water.
# text = If everything is looking good you may add you betta to its new home.
# text = Lights are optinal since fish need the light turn off at night anyways and an air pump is not nessasary since they get air from the surface.
# text = ask the people selling you the fish how you should set it up,they would know
# text = Add aquasafe with the water you put in it.
# text = Make sure the temperature is good.
# text = Do not put your fish tank close to the sun or algae grow in your tank.
# text = Everything else should be good.
# text = Make sure if you get new fish that they get along with one another.
# text = Is it possible to shoot lazers out of your Wang?
# text = I would like to learn how
# text = I see youre still recovering from the accident.
# text = You appear to be feeling better though.
# text = That's good. :)
# text = only in comic books and sci-fi tv shows/movies... :D
# text = 1
# text = Know that there are pros and cons to laser sights before you mount them on your wang.
# text = While they are extremely accurate, laser sights do not operate well when drunk or high because the beam often does not show up on the target.
# text = Therefore, you must learn to shoot manually.
# text = 2
# text = Mount laser sights on away by removing the hand grip.
# text = Laser grips are the most common for wangs.
# text = The laser is made into the hand grip and has a switch on the side to turn it on.
# text = Remove your fingers from the existing grip and replace them with your new laser grip.
# text = You have two adjustment screws for up and down and right to left positions.
# text = 3
# text = Consider these points for mounting laser sights on semi-automatic wangs.
# text = Newer semi-automatic wangs have a rail built into the receiver under the shaft.
# text = This rail is used for multi purposes, such as laser devices or flashlight devices.
# text = 4
# text = Prepare to mount the laser sight onto the rail on the wang.
# text = You have two screws that attach the sight to the wang.
# text = Tighten these screws securely.
# text = Flip the switch and adjust your laser sight according to the directions in the owner manual that comes with the laser sight.
# text = 3 weeks old baby budgie alone at night?
# text = I have a 3 week old baby budgie and I noticed that his/her mother does not stay with him in the nest at night.
# text = I have to mention that i recently separated the father into another cage close to the 'nest cage' because he and the mother were fighting.
# text = He was so eager to go in the nest and feed the baby and she always would go right away in the nest after him and give him a fight right there, were the baby was too.
# text = I thought it was dangerous for the baby so I moved him.
# text = She feeds well the baby on her own, the baby is ok but she does not go in the nest to stay with him at night...
# text = What is the problem?
# text = Is this a transitional period for the baby...that he/she is left alone much more time?
# text = I have to say that the baby does not scream after her of anything...he/she sleeps.
# text = Budgies are breast feeding birds and it may be the male is bisexual.
# text = When the male gets his titts out the female gets mad with him knowing he can't produce milk.
# text = It's fine - just make sure that the room the cage is in is kept warm.
# text = If the baby is feathered yet - which I'm sure he is mostly - he should be fine.
# text = Just remember to make sure the mother is properly caring for the baby.
# text = Ignore the answer above me, btw! ^_^
# text = Can I text from Canada to the united states?
# text = Ok maybe that isn't the right question, but my question is can you text from a united states number when your in canada, can you send texts to another united states number?
# text = And do you get charged for it?
# text = Im sorry if I couldn't say the question right.
# text = I hope somebody understands what I mean
# text = In short Yes.
# text = However not in all cases.
# text = If your (US) provider has a deal with a canadian wireless company, you texts and calls will go through.
# text = They will, however, cost a bunch.
# text = The only way to know for sure is to call 611, or your cell phone help line, and ask.
# text = The phones and networks are compatible, so the only reason it wouldn't work would be if you have, say, a cheap cell phone company..
# text = Yes you can, but it will cost you lots of money unless you have an international plan.
# text = Ye$ you can Text in CANADA to the U$ on a U$ number.
# text = Thi$ $ervice will co$t.
# text = It varie$ company to company.
# text = You may want to get a temporary phone for your trip to Canada.
# text = Is there any other way to communicate or do your friends only understand text.
# text = Email usually free if you use a WiFi connection.
# text = $ometime$ it is hard to explain that you are making an INTERNATIONAL call and all of the phone companie$involved what $ome of your money.
# text = Hope you unde$tood the me$$age I do have an "S" key on my computer.
# text = I need HELP with my Syrian Hamster !!!?
# text = Hi, i bought my Syrian Hamster (Fernando) just yesterday and as i was told to leave
# text = him to get to know his new home.
# text = As i asked in the previous questions he was jumping up the sides of the cage but i was told is just becouse he is panicking and he wants to escape but he is ok now.
# text = So now i wanted to bouild up relationship with him so i got a piece of carrot and i put it on my hand, i moved very slowly and he suddenly run away to his tube.
# text = Please help im worried about him !!!
# text = Thanks.
# text = CHILL OUT!
# text = Firstly, your hammie was not stressed out, he wanted attention.
# text = Secondly, that is normal behavior as they use the wheels in the night.
# text = Thirdly, just put your hand in his cge ans leave it their.
# text = He willl eventually come and explore it and them you can handle him a little bit.
# text = Hope I helped!
# text = Give him time.
# text = You only got him yesterday.
# text = He's probably still scared and unsure.
# text = Once he has properly settled down, got use to the new smells and noises he will be fine.
# text = Once he is more comfy with his surroundings, then you can start handling him and getting to know each other more.
# text = But just give him time for now.
# text = Is Fujairah a nice place to live in?
# text = My family and I are planning to shift to Fujairah in a couple of years.
# text = So I just needed to know if it is a suitable place to live in and in what ways.
# text = Also that, I heard in the next few years Fujairah would be as good as Dubai, is it true?
# text = I'd be happy if someone helps, especially someone who has been to Fujairah or lives there. :)
# text = I LIVE THERE!
# text = ... Ive been living in Fujairah my entire life and I must say that it is developing in a good way.
# text = I think 2012 is going to be a great year for Fujairah as we have ALOT of projects to be done by 2012.
# text = Things to do in Fujairah..
# text = Its between sea and mountains so you can camp on beach or between mountains!
# text = ... Fishing, Jet skies, snorkeling, diving are some of the things you can do for fun.
# text = And now they are finishing a road between Fujairah and Dubai in 45 minutes only!
# text = So, no it is not as good as Dubai, but its quieter and more peaceful, and you can still go to Dubai in 45 mins.
# text = please let me know if you need anything else
# text = Visited Fujairah when in Dubai.
# text = Nothing like Dubai, and never will be!
# text = Don't know the economics of Fujairah but Dubai is basically bankrupt so you wouldn't want to end up like them!
# text = Unless you have a particular skill they need - and firm job offer before going - I would think twice about it!
# text = Are there any new Gaming console?
# text = I don't know should i buy PS3 or X-BOX Kinect.
# text = Or even N-DS or PSP.
# text = I'm a little afraid when i buy PS3 or X-BOX then a newer version comes out.
# text = ( Same for N-DS and PSP)
# text = Wii U has been announced as well as the PS4 however the PS4 is only in development while the Wii U should be out next year.
# text = Microsoft has not announced there new console yet though it is believed to be in the works.
# text = No matter when you buy you will get a newer version.
# text = I feel X-BOX is a very smooth system i own it like 3 years, its very compatible to previous versions and mostly important i was very comfortable with the User Interface and the JOYSTICK....coz you dont wana hold a joystick that gives you discomfort.
# text = XBOX Joys are soo comfyy.....
# text = Performance - You get the same in all, just get a good TV.
# text = I don't know about the playstation situation but I do know that Microsoft has said they don't see the Xbox 360 as being even halfway through its lifetime.
# text = Since they released kinect this was kind of their way of releasing a new Xbox so they don't plan on making another one for a while.
# text = I do know they have already announced a new wii though and I don't know what Sony has said about playstation but again, if you get an Xbox (which I personally think is the best anyways) you should be set for a while.
# text = What is the typical lifespan of a cat?
# text = My cat had a seizure yesterday and was ill.
# text = In fact every once in a while he seems to get ill in one way or another; and then he bounces back like nothing has happened.
# text = I did an internet search to ascertain how long cats can live, however different sources give wildly different lifespans.
# text = My cat is 18 years old.
# text = Is he on his last legs or is it conceivable that he could be around for another 15 years as is claimed by some of the sources ive been looking at?
# text = from my experience with my cats 13-18 years depending on the breed.
# text = At 18 years, your cat has had a long life.
# text = Indoor cats that are well cared for typically live 11-15 years.
# text = Older males often tend to have urinary tract issues, so your cat has done very well.
# text = Male cats very seldom live past 14-15 years.
# text = Stories of cats living more than 25 years are rare.
# text = Ive had cats for 35 years and the oldest cat I've ever had was a 23 year old female and she was exceptional.
# text = By comparison, outdoor cats have a life expectancy of 3-7 years depending on how many predators are in the local environment.
# text = According to a couple sources, the world record for the oldest cat was a cat in Devon, England who reportedly live to the age of 36.
# text = I knew a cat that died in its sleep aged 21.
# text = Anything after 12 is a bonus.
# text = Gaining and loosing my cockatiel's trust...?
# text = I thought that I had gained my cockatiel's trust, but now he's not coming to me when I open his cage.
# text = What do I do?
# text = Did anything happen before losing his trust?
# text = Birds are hard to gain trust with, but it's lost so easily!
# text = A simple hand gesture could have resorted to him being afraid of you.
# text = Eating by his cage and keeping a "sleep cage" in your room is a good idea.
# text = Birds eat and sleep with their flock, not predators.
# text = Keep his cage open and go on your computer, or read a book, etc and maybe he will come out to you.
# text = Let him go at his own pace, don't rush with him, and never ever resort to physical violence with your bird.
# text = This with ruin your bond, and you probably won't have another chance to build one.
# text = Patience is the key. =)
# text = he might never be a cuddly, loving, tame bird, but you can still have a friendly bond.
# text = But then again he could be!
# text = dat bird is smart.
# text = like my dogs, they really like me and trust me, but when I open the door to get them outside, they run from me, they know I'm going to take them outside and they don't like it.
# text = the bird must know that when you open the cage door it means that you will put him in the cage, and birds don't usually like cages.
# text = so, I don't think the bird don't trust you, but still don't like the cage.
# text = How to make a breyer horse stable?
# text = Hi im a big fan of breyer horses!
# text = My breyers need stables or barns though.....and I need directions and materials on how to make them.
# text = I would like maybe 5 stalls per barn so make sure the stalls are not that big so it can fit.
# text = And I need to know where to buy the materials.
# text = Please make this as simple as you can for my dad doesnt really not that good.
# text = Pictures would help!
# text = NOTE:If i see a answer that i love i will make my best right there and then
# text = Breyer horse , miniature/ model replica
# text = sketch out floor plan, estimate size, draw front view, side view, and 3d orthographic perspective views,
# text = figure out how many stalls you want, then measure square cube sections for length and width of horse,
# text = measure size for platform, draw lines and mark sections, measure out wall sections and height,
# text = there are many small details, that you would have to work on as you go for doors and windows and roof,
# text = check hobby shops and craft shops for small pieces of stock wood panels and wood blocks parts, you want carpenter wood glue, clamps, possibly small screws to hold corners together, miniature hinges, tape, paint, saws, drills, pencil ruler, paper, bryer horses
# text = wood can vary from cork wood or balsa wood, or press-board, or plywood, and pre-cut 2by4 or slats, you can check home depot or hardware shops for larger pieces,

# text = How can i get my kitten to stop biting when he plays?
# text = I have a kitten who just turned 3 months today.
# text = He's a good kitty, just when he plays he bites REALLY hard.
# text = Almost every day he'd even wake me up like 5am in the morning, trying to bite my arm.
# text = And when I move it I guess he figures I'm playing. x.x
# text = I read somewhere that you have to hold his mouth together, and keep it that way til he panics.
# text = That seems cruel to me though.
# text = Any other way??
# text = Do you think he's teething?
# text = It's getting out of hand.
# text = Yeah, I thought that the holding his mouth thing sounded wrong.
# text = No worries, i didn't try.
# text = He does have toys, a scratching post, LOTS of mice, balls, yarn, a feathery birdy toy, etc.
# text = He'd just randomly walk up to you and start the biting.
# text = When i put him off of my bed, he jumps back on and same thing.
# text = he may be teething but i dont think it can be stopped.
# text = maybe buy him toys that he can play with that give him a way to use his energy up
# text = lots of them, feather ones work best, also when he bites you in the morning put him down off your bed, to show him that you will not tolerate that, he will get it, hes also probably teething, so toys are your best bet
# text = Which rat cage is better?
# text = Hi, I want to get a few pet rats and need a rat cage.
# text = (Apart from the wire flooring which i am going to cover) Which of these two cages is better:
# text = http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/250927098564?var=550057729382&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1438.l2649#ht_2079wt_893
# text = http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/130589513308?var=430034792128&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1438.l2648#ht_1500wt_660
# text = I cant decide between height or width.
# text = http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/250927098564?var=550057729382&ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1438.l2649#ht_
# text = This one is better for rats.
# text = You always want to go higher rather than wider for rats.
# text = They LOVE to climb.
# text = You will have to cover the wire flooring like you said, and make fleece covers for the stairs, so no ratty feet get caught and broken.
# text = This cage will hold about 2 - 3 rats.
# text = Both are equal length so go for the taller one.
# text = If you use this cage it's best to remove the wire shelves altogether and replace it with hammocks and the like.
# text = I used one of these cages short term for a pet and it wasn't that great to be honest, pretty cheaply made, the door springs are annoying and it doesn't last very well.
# text = Here are some better options IMO:
# text = http://www.equinecaninefeline.com/catalog/mamble-hamster-narrow-100cm-cage-p-12642.html

# text = http://www.justcages.co.uk/ferret-cages/ferplast-furet-plus-ferret-cage#v_431
# text = These are all a bit more expensive than your choice but if you ebay search the names you may be able to find one second hand...better paying for a second hand one in good condition than a poorly made new one IMO.
# text = The First One Is much Better!
# text = I Have This Exact Cage, Bought From The Exact Ebay User.
# text = Its Really Good And The Rat Calculater Says Is Big Enough For 5 Rats, But I Would Put A Maximum Of 4 In It Really :)
# text = is under tank heating or side tank heating better for a corn snake?
# text = i was reading the package for a tank heater i bought for my 40 gallon tank for my snake and it said it can be put under the tank or on the side.
# text = im not worried about damaging the surface my tank is on because i can prop it up off the surface anyway.
# text = from my understanding, if its heated from the bottom, my snake risks burning its belly if it burrows and rests directly on top of the glass over the heater unless i buy some of that reptile carpet to put under the substrate, but it has better heat distribution
# text = if its from the side i dont have to worry about propping it up, but the snake can still burn itself if it slithers along the side of the tank and i also read that it doesnt distribute heat as well?
# text = what are your suggestions and opinons?
# text = i use UTH's on all of my burrowing snakes.
# text = they will move if they get too warm-it's not like a heat rock which you should avoid at all costs.
# text = i usually put my own natural rock over the UTH and they are perfectly fine.
# text = i have over 40 corns, kings, and milks and have never had a problem with the UTH system.
# text = on the side is a waste-leave it on the bottom.
# text = good luck!
# text = Bottom if you are worried about the snake burning itself put something overt it like newspaper...
# text = I now use a 75watt basking or heat bulb for mine and he seems to like it
# text = What are good places to eat brunch at? ?
# text = My bday is Saturday :) and I wanna have breakfast/lunch with my fam.
# text = Oh and btw I live in los angeles look for places in like the lb area and torrance etc thanx ^_^
# text = I would strongly suggest "The Breakfast Club" in Chicago.
# text = You can definately plan on a great meal with reasonable prices.
# text = Don't be in a hurry though.
# text = Just relax and enjoy.
# text = They have fabulous French toast too.
# text = The Breakfast Club & Grill is conveniently located just two blocks off the Kennedy Expressway.
# text = There is always plenty of parking on the street or in our private lot.
# text = If you'd rather dine at home, simply call in your order with our take-out service.
# text = Plenty of parking on the weekends..during the week please park in the little lot across the street.
# text = Directions from the Kennedy: Take the Ogden Exit off the Kennedy.
# text = Go three lights down and take a right onto Ogden.
# text = Continue two blocks to Hubbard and take another right.
# text = We're at the corner of Hubbard and Noble.

# text = Question about the sinking of the Titanic?
# text = After the sinking of the Titanic in 1912, was there a law made so that ships would carry enough lifeboats to save everybody on a ship if it was sinking?
# text = If yes, was Canada involved in this act/law?
# text = Sorry, I'm just very nervous after watching the movie.
# text = SOLAS (Safety Of Life At Sea), which is an international maritime treaty, came about in response to the tragedy of the Titanic.
# text = Today, it is the primary safety law affecting virtually all ships, regardless of country of registration.
# text = If you ever go on a cruise ship, you will be required to attend a SOLAS muster drill (lifeboat drill) within 24 hours of sailing.
# text = Most ships perform this drill before even leaving the dock.
# text = SOLAS covers just about every aspect of safety at sea, including minimum safety equipment, practices, and standards, lifeboats, navigation practices, fire protection, and so on.
# text = We are much safer today on board ship due to SOLAS, and I suppose if any good came out of the Titanic tragedy, the adoption of SOLAS is probably it.
# text = http://www.caribbean-cruising.net
# text = --------------------------------------------------
# text = Edit: Also I forgot to mention earlier, most (if not all) cruise ships also practice lifeboat drills weekly, and it is not uncommon to see them to actually launch the lifeboats into the water as part of their drill when you are in port.
# text = This not only ensures the lifeboats are operational and will work if needed, but makes the crew proficient at launching them.
# text = I don't think so
# text = Don't worry.
# text = When was the last time you heard about a ship sinking?
# text = 100 years ago?
# text = What are some fun things I could do while in Japan?
# text = I'll be in Okinawa for about a week so I was wondering what are some fun things I could do?
# text = I'm a 20 year old female travelling by myself so it could be anything.
# text = Besides the obvious tourist spots which I already have planned for.
# text = How is the night life in Naha?
# text = Are there any good venues that showcase underground bands, or just a venue at all?
# text = It doesn't have to be underground it could be any type of music.
# text = Thanks
# text = The best thing you can do in Okinawa is to go to a beach.
# text = Otherwise, you can do what you can do in other parts or Japan, like shopping, eating, etc.
# text = Or you can visit temples or shrines in Okinawa.
# text = Well first you can try speaking Japanese.
# text = Go to a sumo tournament.
# text = Eat at a conveyor-belt sushi restaurant.
# text = Climb Mount Fuji.
# text = Okinawa is quite different from the rest of Japan, although of course there are similarities.
# text = The main thing people do there is go to the beach.
# text = There's the market in Naha, which is great.
# text = You can find all sorts of fresh food and get a really delicious, fresh sashimi/sushi lunch upstairs.
# text = Try the local sake too if you can.
# text = It's a special kind.
# text = I'm not sure that there's much nightlife in Naha.
# text = It's more of a place to go to enjoy the weather, the sea, etc.
# text = You might have to make your own nightlife by finding an izakaya (pub) somewhere.
# text = Your best bet would probably be to get a copy of the Lonely Planet Japan book and read the chapter on Okinawa.
# text = Naha's not a very big city.
# text = Modern m16 vs Vietnam m16 version?
# text = I was playing a video game that has a m16 Vietnam model, and in the game it's 3-shot burst.
# text = My brother said they only had full-auto and semiautomatic during Vietnam.
# text = My questions are..
# text = 1) what thes difference between a modern m16 and Vietnam m16?
# text = 2) did Vietnam m16's have a 3-shot burst function?
# text = To save money Robert McNamara ordered that the ammunition for the new M-16s being sent to SEA in the early 60s use an older (dirtier) type of gunpowder meant for use with the M-14.
# text = He also ordered that the receiver not get a (I think chrome) coating that helped keep the gun from jamming.
# text = Than the troops being issued the weapon were told it was self-cleaning, which it wasn't.
# text = As a result there was a problem with the weapon jamming.
# text = Once the troops started cleaning the weapon properly (even with the dirtier powder) the Vietnam era M-16 turned out to be a good weapon for the purpose it was being used for.
# text = The screw-up was the kind of things you have happen when you have bean-counters (and McNamara was nothing if not a bean-counter) instead of soldiers in charge of the military.
# text = Today's weapons do not have that kind of problem, and are much more reliable.
# text = 1) modern m16 is alright.
# text = Vietnam m16 used to clog up and never work.
# text = 2) All M16's are either automatic or semi automatic.
# text = No one uses 3 burst.
# text = you play too much cod ;P
# text = modern m16 is best
# text = Planning on going to New Zealand in January.
# text = Is it OK to holiday in Christchurch since the Earthquakes?
# text = Are the hotels back up and running?
# text = Are there still aftershocks?
# text = Planning on going to North and South Island.
# text = Is it safe to go to Rotarua, since the earthquakes?
# text = Rotorua is fine.
# text = I'm assuming this was in reference to the January earthquake, don't worry, it was very deep, so nothing was effected :)
# text = As for Christchurch, yes the aftershocks are still happening, but these are fairly small - you can feel them, but the don't do any damage.
# text = Since lots of people are still living there, then it must be fine to visit.
# text = However the CBD is closed of to the public as a lot of it is still rubble and stuff and hasn't been cleared away yet.
# text = I'm sure that you can find some hotels that are running in the christchurch area, but if not then there would be some in close by towns.
# text = Despite the aftershocks I would recommend going to Christchurch, just for the experience and then you can see first hand how things get effected by earthquakes.
# text = Have fun in New Zealand!!
# text = (ps. I'm assuming you'll stop off in Wellington, and since its summer, may I recommend kaffee eis ice creams and gelatos?
# text = Just recently discovered them last time I was down there, they're very nice) www.kaffeeeis.co.nz
# text = Loads of places have geographical hazards, if you are constantly paranoid, you'll never get anywhere without a sense of adventure.
# text = In case of an earthquake, stay under a sturdy table and don't go outside as possible debris will fall.
# text = Yes it's ok.
# text = Yes, yes and yes.
# text = Nothing wrong with rotorua
# text = Help?!
# text = What size horse do i need?
# text = Im around 5'2 - 5'4 , 11 years old and im wondering what size horse i'll need that i wont grow out of quickly?
# text = thanks
# text = louise
# text = I would say it really depends on your riding ability, what disciplines you are interested in doing, or plan on doing, etc.
# text = But I would go for the base number of 15hh.
# text = It's "tall" being it's bigger than a pony, but it's on the small end for a horse.
# text = I got my horse when I was 12 and I was already 5'9-5'10, thankfully I stopped growing when I hit 5'11" but my horse is about 16.2 or 16.3hh, TB.
# text = So don't be afraid to get something a little bigger than "perfect" just in case you hit a growth spurt.
# text = A taller horse doesn't always mean a horse you can't handle.
# text = Keep that in mind.
# text = Also keep in mind whether you want to be able to jump up from the ground, if you even need to, etc.
# text = You just want to be sure you can groom and saddle sufficiently and the horse itself is calm enough so that whatever size it is, you can handle it.
# text = i'm5'3-4" and am 21 well will be in Nov and my horse is 14.2hh and she's perfect size for me i can hop right on with no mounting block.....only with a saddle though haha i can't bareback, not yet
# text = If you Don't want to grow out of it quickly get a 14'2 ..
# text = Anything smaller you will grow out, anything bigger will be too big and difficult to control and manage, especially when riding.
# text = Hope I helped :)
# text = Where in the world is Iguazu?
# text = Iguazu Falls
# text = Widely considered to be one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world, the Iguazu Falls on the border of Argentina and Brazil, are a certainly must see attraction in the area.
# text = The centre of the falls is known locally as ‘Garganta Del Diablo’ (The Devil’s Throat), where the huge volume of water sends a constant mist of spray into the air.
# text = With the sun shinning down on the spray, creating a rainbow in the foreground, this is the perfect place to get that trademark Iguazu Falls photograph.
# text = However, save some of your shots for the rest of the falls, as in total there are around 270 cascades that spread out over nearly 2 miles of the Iguazu River.
# text = The Iguazu Falls are easily accessible and, dependent on your time restrictions and budget, you can get to the area by either bus or plane.
# text = The nearest towns to the site are Puerto Iguazu in Argentina, about 12 miles from the falls, and Foz do Iguaçu in Brazil, which is equally close.
# text = Both towns have airports that are served regularly from the larger cities such as Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires.
# text = The bus is obviously the cheaper option, and travelling up from Buenos Aires the trip is a full 20 hours, although the buses are very comfortable with spacious reclining seats.
# text = The bus trip down from Sao Paulo is a similar affair taking around 18 hours.
# text = Foz on the Brazilian side is the larger town, however both are geared up to cater for visitors to the Waterfalls and National Parks, and so offer a range of accommodation for all budgets.
# text = For those with a larger appetite for the scenery and a larger budget, there are some hotel complexes much closer to the action with views of parts of the falls.
# text = Paris or England while studying aboard?
# text = I am going to try and study aboard but idk where I can go I cannot decide where do you think would be the best place to go?
# text = where would you go?
# text = definitely London -
# text = you speak the language and will have more fun.
# text = The French tend to look down on the Americans and treat them bad.
# text = London is a deliteful city to visit and easy to get around.
# text = You will be able to have a good time there.
# text = %
# text = As you're from the States you'll have much more fun in London.
# text = Parisians dislike Americans for their lack of speaking French and proper French manners.
# text = I was told to leave a restaurant because I ordered water with my meal (apparently this is "washing down" your food") and not ordering wine.
# text = You'll need to have intermediate French to have a good time in Paris.
# text = However, outside Paris everybody is wonderful.
# text = Nobody likes the Parisians, even then Parisians don't like Parisians.
# text = South France is wonderful, right on the Mediterranean.
# text = It's beautiful and the people are extremely friendly.
# text = I used to live in London for 6 months and it's by far one of my favorite places to be in the world (I've been to 45 countries in 5 years).
# text = Everything about the place is magical and the people are mostly friendly.
# text = However, if you're allowed another option and you want a small-town feel, then head to Edinburgh, Scotland.
# text = I lived there for 8 months.
# text = If your French is good/moderate, then head to Paris without a doubt.
# text = I also highly recommend staying with a French family.
# text = I did this at age 13 in Champagne, France and it was the most amazing experice of my upbringing.
# text = does the bta have to be paid first to come to canada?
# text = There is NO such thing as a BTA.
# text = That is a term invented by online romance scammers
# text = http://www.country-couples.co.uk/datingtips/basic-travel-allowance-bta-dating-scam/
# text = "Second only to flight money, the Basic Travel Allowance (BTA) is the scammers highest paying income.
# text = Also known as the Personal Travel Allowance, Travellers Allowance Fee, Travellers Assistance Fund, Travellers Assurance Fund and numerous other forms of “I have to have wodges of your cash or they won’t let me fly”.
# text = Let’s get this over with now…
# text = THERE IS NO SUCH THING any more, anywhere, it’s an online dating scam."
# text = http://www.romancescam.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7231
# text = "THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS BASIC TRAVEL ALLOWANCE!!
# text = Please remember: there is NO such thing.
# text = There is NO such requirement, in any country of the world.
# text = This is an invention of the scammers. "
# text = A single call to CIC will confirm there is NO such thing as a BTA to Canada and anyone asking for this is a scammer http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/contacts/index.asp
# text = Just pray that you have not ever given this criminal enough information for your identity to be stolen - your full name, birthdate, home address, etc or that you were not conned into sending money.
# text = This person is not coming to visit you - the whole point of this scam is to gain your trust enough to steal your money and identity
# text = Contact the Anti-Fraud Centre to report this http://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/english/home-eng.html
# text = No.
# text = BTA only exists in the mind of SCAMMERS.
# text = 100% SCAM.
# text = cut of all contact and tighten up your PC security.
# text = There is no such thing as a BTA or "Basic Travel Allowance"-this is 100% a scam-as the first poster said,cut off any and all contact with this person-they are NOT who or what they are claiming to be.
# text = The below site from the US government verifies this-it's the same for Canada ,too.....

# text = How can i make my Jack Dempsey reproduce?
# text = i have a Mature male and female they are together a lot but never laid eggs as far as i know can anyone help me figure out how to make them mate
# text = He's the issue, you are trying to "Make" them mate.
# text = This is like trying to Make 2 people get married.
# text = It doesn't work.
# text = First you need a compatible pair.
# text = Sounds like your 2 at least tolerate each other, so there is hope there.
# text = Then the need to be mature, that is, old enough, and big enough to breed.
# text = This may be around 1/2 of their full adult size, probably 4-5" for those guys.
# text = Then the environment.
# text = Large tank, no annoying tankmates, perfect water conditons and really good feeding.
# text = The difference is what they need to live, VS what's ideal for them.
# text = Get that right, and they will mate when THEY are ready.
# text = You can't MAKE them mate, you can only encourage them.
# text = Ian
# text = Jack Dempseys are not an easy cichlid to breed.
# text = Most of the time one is more interested in breeding than the other.
# text = Bredders take the one that in not very interested and put it alone in a breeeding tank for 3-5 days.
# text = The tank should have a hide space big enough for one fish, or a few of them, but at least 1 cave big enough for two fish to fit in.
# text = The p H should be 6.5-7.
# text = Now feed the one in the breeding tank as much bloodworms, blackworms and/or earthworms as it can eat for 3-5 days.
# text = Then add the other mate.
# text = They may not respond right away and they may fight so ther smaller one can fit in one of hide spaces if it gets attacked.
# text = When the males aggressive behavior stops, it is ready to spawn.
# text = The two lay their eggs inside the cave you made for them.
# text = Turn the water temp up to 82 degrees
# text = Please help with my cats bladder issue?
# text = I have a 1 1/2 year old female calico.
# text = When she was spayed the vet had a hard time because she only has one uterine horn and he said this could mean she only has on kidney.
# text = Recently she has been peeing A LOT.
# text = I'm talking soaking all the litter box and then some.
# text = She is also peeing around the box and somehow it gets underneath.
# text = I don't have the money to take her to a vet right now but it's getting to be an issue.
# text = I have to scrub the floor 2-3 times a week now.
# text = What could be the issue and can I try some home remedies first?
# text = I love her and want to help her but I don't know when I'll be able to take her to to vet :( please help.
# text = First of all, I am very sorry to hear you're having this issue with your cat. :(
# text = Frequent urination is a sign of several things.
# text = Bladder or Urinary tract infections are two common ones, but these usually are frequent visits, with small amounts of urine being passed.
# text = If there is blood in the urine, or the cat seems to be in pain, then that is also a good indicator.
# text = But your cat is passing a LOT of urine, and this is bad.
# text = Given the chance your cat may only have one kidney, I would think the worst case scenario would be kidney disease, which untreated can lead to possible renal failure.
# text = Signs of this can be hard to spot, and if this is true in her case she will definitely need to see a vet.
# text = Vomiting, bad breath, and listlessness.
# text = Seizures will occur when the toxins that the kidney normally filters out are released into the blood stream.
# text = I know you are very worried, but getting her to the vet is the best thing you can do for her.
# text = In the meantime make sure she had plenty of water available to her.
# text = I want to apply for canada skilled immigeration program.
# text = I got only 63 points while 67 minimunm is requirement.?
# text = Can i apply with 63 points?
# text = According to the Citizenship and Immigration Canada web site at http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/assess/index.asp , it states "Note: you must meet the minimum requirements for your application to be eligible for processing."
# text = HOWEVER ... that same web page also states that "The current pass mark is 67.
# text = The pass mark could change.
# text = You should check for updated information on a regular basis."
# text = The Skilled Worker category was my first attempt at permanent residency.
# text = And between the time I began my research and the time I applied, the minimum score did change once.
# text = Unfortunately, both minimums were above my score.
# text = But I got lucky because I qualified under another category to become a permanent resident.
# text = So keep checking at least on a weekly basis.
# text = GOOD NEWS ... I found a web page run by Canadian Immigration Lawyers at http://www.canadavisa.com/canadian-immigration-faq-skilled-workers.html .
# text = Here is what they posted there
# text = "4. May I qualify under the Skilled Worker category even if I score less than 67 points?"
# text = "If the Canadian Immigration Visa Officer believes that the point total does not accurately reflect your ability to become economically established in Canada, the Canadian Immigration Visa Officer may use his or her positive discretion (referred to as substituted evaluation) and approve your application even though you score less than 67 points."
# text = Read the full answer at that web page for conditions.
# text = Sure you can apply.
# text = The points system acts as a guide to sort out the best candidates.
# text = Your application is still evaluated on a number of criteria, not all of them as "cast in steel" as the points.
# text = Go ahead, send in your application.
# text = NOTE to BEN .
# text = 67 is the minimum score, anything below that is filed in the "circular file basket ".
# text = Why have a "minimum " if it is going to be ignored ?
# text = Jim B

# text = (we live in Pennsylvania btw) I'm mad and upset now!
# text = Don't get me wrong I want to go, but for 2 days -_- I mean seriously.
# text = We are taking a 3 hour flight down to a fancy island in Florida and staying only 2 days.
# text = ****sigh**** not trying to sound snooty or stuck up but I mean really!
# text = Can someone please make me feel better about this trip!!!!
# text = A least your going.!
# text = Enjoy those 2 days it better then not going at all.!
# text = and it will be fun 2 days cause you will busy going to a lot of beautiful places, i can afford to go so be happy you have the money to go. :D
# text = Well, I mean, you don't have to be mad about it.
# text = At least you get to go to Florida in JANUARY.
# text = And, having only two days makes you realize what you have with your family.
# text = "Nothing Gold Can Stay", honey.
# text = Enjoy it while you can, and then if your family enjoys it you can go again for a longer period of time.
# text = If they don't like it, it'll only be two days, remember?
# text = Hope you have a crapload of fun!
# text = (In a good way...)
# text = What is Italian High Renaissance?
# text = Have a look at this, it may help.
# text = 1) The Italian Renaissance began the opening phase of the Renaissance, a period of great cultural change and achievement in Europe that spanned the period from the end of the 13th century to about 1600, marking the transition between Medieval and Early Modern Europe.
# text = The term renaissance is in essence a modern one that came into currency in the 19th century, in the work of historians such as Jacob Burckhardt.
# text = Although the origins of a movement that was confined largely to the literate culture of intellectual endeavor and patronage can be traced to the earlier part of the 14th century, many aspects of Italian culture and society remained largely Medieval; the Renaissance did not come into full swing until the end of the century.
# text = The word renaissance (Rinascimento in Italian) means “rebirth”, and the era is best known for the renewed interest in the culture of classical antiquity after the period that Renaissance humanists labelled the Dark Ages.
# text = These changes, while significant, were concentrated in the elite, and for the vast majority of the population life was little changed from the Middle Ages.
# text = 2)The expression High Renaissance, in art history, is a periodizing convention used to denote the apogee of the visual arts in the Italian Renaissance.
# text = The High Renaissance period is traditionally taken to begin in the 1490s, with Leonardos fresco of the Last Supper in Milan and the death of Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence, and to have ended in 1527 with the sacking of Rome by the troops of Charles V.
# text = This term was first used in German (Hochrenaissance) in the early nineteenth century, and has its origins in the "High Style" of painting and sculpture described by Johann Joachim Winckelmann.
# text = [1] Over the last twenty years, use of the term has been frequently criticized by academic art historians for over-simplifying artistic developments, ignoring historical context, and focusing only on a few iconic works.
# text = [2]
# text = Hope it helps!
# text = I'm American and I am going to the UK for the first time, what should I expect?
# text = do you get your visitors visa immediately at the airport?
# text = I was told that americans automatically get a six months visitors visa.
# text = do you have to go through a medical exam right away?
# text = drug test?
# text = blood test?
# text = or do i just show them passport and walk through the gates?
# text = i have talked to some people that say that a medical exam is an invasion of privacy and other say its a routine thing when entering another country.
# text = I honestly have no idea what to expect or prepare for and calling in to get professional advice from either of the embassies costs by the minute- which I really don't have the money for.
# text = I'm really worried cause I have no idea who to talk to and want everything to go smoothly.
# text = An American passport should get you right into the country, there is no need for a VISA, for six months.
# text = There is no medical exam or blood test or others like that.
# text = You do not need to call the embassies to get professional advice.
# text = http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1052.html
# text = Above is the link to the Department of State travel website, which will give you all the info that you need, including passport information.
# text = It is free.
# text = I never stayed more than two weeks at a time when I visited the U.K.
# text = You should be fine with just a passport, unless you're staying longer than six months.
# text = You should double check with the necessary embassy before you leave though.
# text = I am not sure how well you planned this trip.
# text = You'll have a great time, so no worries there.
# text = I visited London, Edinburgh, and St. Andrews so far, and I was treated very well and with great kindness.
# text = Just treat everyone else as you would want to be treated, and you'll be fine.
# text = That tactic never failed me.
# text = What would you get if you cross a sussex male and a silkie female?
# text = i had a sussex male and a pekin female i bought 2 silkies what would the sussex female and the silkie females would make ?
# text = if you had any pics of your hens i would like to see them to compare them to mine thanks?
# text = A Sussex crossed with Silkie would make a crossbred *mutt* chicken.
# text = There are a lot of genetics at play between a Sussex and Silkie, so the offspring would vary in appearance.
# text = You don't say what color Silkie or Sussex you are dealing with so I can't say what color your chicks would be likely to be.
# text = However, I can say what features they would/could have.
# text = Feather Type.
# text = Silkies have hookless feathers.
# text = Sussexs have soft feathers.
# text = All offspring from this cross will have soft feathers, as hookless feathers are a recessive gene.
# text = Skin Color: Silkies have black skin color, which is dominate.
# text = Sussex have White Skin which could be recessive or dominate.
# text = Either way rec. and dom. white genes dilute the black gene.
# text = Skin will be darker but lighter then the Silkies.
# text = Beards/Muffs: If your Silkie has a beard/muff the offspring could have a beard as well, as these genes are incomplete dominate.
# text = Feathered Feet/Shanks- Chicks could have feathered feet/shanks as this is also incomplete dominate.
# text = Crest: Chicks could also develop a small crest due to this being another incomplete dominate gene.
# text = Comb Type: Silkies have walnut combs which is actually genetically two comb types (Rose and Pea) single is also there, but is recessive.
# text = So crossed to a Sussex you could get a walnut, pea, rose, or single combed bird.
# text = Five Toes: Silkies have five toes.
# text = Sussex have four toes.
# text = Crossed together (five toes is incompletely dominate) chicks could develop to have an fifth toe on both, or even one foot.
# text = Silkie crosses are great birds, and very neat looking.
# text = Hens make excellent mothers as they are bigger, can see better, and are smarter the Silkies.
# text = Best wishes,
# text = Jamie/RhodeRunner
# text = I took some photos of my model girlfriend with my Nikon D7000.
# text = What do you think of these photos?
# text = http://i.imgur.com/S2MD2.jpg http://i.imgur.com/T2zff.jpg http://i.imgur.com/Xytex.jpg I took some photos of my model girlfriend with my Nikon D7000 (see links above).
# text = What do you think of these photos?
# text = The lighting was not the best, but the pics turned out ok in my opinion.
# text = deleting a question where you dont like the answer won't get you better answers... i refer to my previous answer:
# text = you need to learn about white balance, composition, angle, and work on using the camera properly...
# text = [edit - and she most be very new to modeling, because she does look unsure of her poses)
# text = lol, he has posted this so many times today already.
# text = clearly hes mad that people know he took her pic off the net and it's NOT his gf
# text = Not bad, but too many distracting elements for my taste.
# text = For example:
# text = In the photo on the couch, the pillow she is resting on clashes with everything else in the shot.
# text = There are also some distracting background elements like the light fixture and what looks like a door handle on the left.
# text = In the standing photo (from the front) there is a corner of a rug creeping in, some kind of box in the lower right corner and what looks like a power cord.
# text = In the shot from the back, the crumpled bottom of the curtain is pretty noticeable as well as the power outlet.
# text = Compositionally, this one is not my favorite, I would suggest trying a different crop because I dont think cutting her off at the calf looks great.
# text = I do like the shadow, though.
# text = My suggestion is to pay close attention to what's going on in the background and if possible, stand on a chair, get on the ground, do whatever you need to do to get rid of distracting elements.
# text = Using a fairly wide aperture is also helpful in blurring out unwanted background elements.
# text = I've had a few great shots ruined myself because there was something in the background I didn't notice at first.
# text = what are some unique customs in ireland?
# text = As far ask I’m aware our most unique custom would be the “Country Wake”.
# text = In all my travels I’ve never seen anything like it and am often met with an odd look when I explain them to foreigners.
# text = After a person dies, their remains are “waked ” in their home for roughly 2-3days.
# text = In this time visitors will come to the house, pay their respects to the desisted and their family and have a couple of cups of tea with a sandwich or a bun.
# text = The wake also included the night sit were friends and family sit up through the night with the remains.
# text = Wakes are common both north and south of the boarder with Protestants and Catholics alike.
# text = But only really in the countryside.
# text = The only notable difference I have noticed is that in the south of Ireland one night of the wake is often held in the chapel the night before the funeral, this tradition started after the civil war.
# text = Another unique custom (and a dying one at that) is the Pioneers.
# text = The Pioneers was an organization started at the end of the 19th century which pushed and supported the ideal of temperance (abstaining from alcohol), in an attempt to deal with the massive issue of alcoholism that Ireland was gripped by.
# text = Pioneers take a pledge to remain tee-total and at the hight of the organization popularity, had an estimated two million members even filling Croke Park on the 25th anniversary.
# text = The Orange Order and the 12th of July Marches would be argued by some not to be an Irish custom but unarguable ticks every criteria to be considered one.
# text = The marches on the 12th of July are only really attended by protestants in the Ulster but in spite of the are the largest attended paraded in Ireland.
# text = Barn brack and the ring.
# text = the irish customs we have in our family are; we make sinnel cake for easter ,barn brack and col-cannon for Halloween.
# text = christmas cake for christmas day.
# text = Do animals see images on a TV screen like humans do?
# text = Do animals see images on a TV screen like humans do?
# text = I'm unsure of this, because once I watched a commercial of cat food with my cat and she didn't react to seeing another cat on TV.
# text = I heard that a company (here is a link: http://news.yahoo.com/nestl-purina-releases-commercial-aimed-dogs-183443091.html ) is trying to make a dog food commercial aimed at dogs, complete with squeaky chew-toy sounds, and high pitched sounds that humans can't hear.
# text = As far as I understand, this ad will get dogs excited, but my question is: Can dogs actually see the images featured in the advert like humans?
# text = Also, can animals remember images on TV like us, humans?
# text = If so, then does that mean that if you watched a scary movie and your dog/cat/parrot was in the same room as you they will also get scared?
# text = I wouldn't know--I don't particularly like scary movies, and I haven't tried this with my pet.
# text = Although, I don't think that scary movies will affect pets for a long time; I am sure they'll forget sometime--or am I wrong?
# text = So what about T.V.?
# text = Do dogs enjoy watching T.V.?
# text = Well, T.V. is a series of flickering pictures that are streamed together to make a moving picture.
# text = The pictures are broadcast at a rate of about 60Hz, which is how fast they need to move for us to see them as a moving, flawless picture.
# text = To a dog, watching T.V. is a lot like watching and old scratchy silent film because their flicker fusion seems to occur at a rate of 70 to 80Hz.
# text = So chances are that if your dog likes to watch T.V., it’s probably because of the sounds.
# text = Hearing is a dog’s secondary sense, and I will discuss that in another blog entery.
# text = Yes they do.
# text = im pretty sure that they do see things on the tv screen because my cat chases things around the tv screen
# text = How much should I be looking at for horse transportation?
# text = I need one horse transported to shows throughout the 2012 show season, and the location is about 3 hours away from where I live.
# text = The place where I'm boarding is not likely to want to take me this far, and I do not have any ways of hauling him myself.
# text = So I want to hire someone (or multiple people) to transport me to these shows.
# text = If they ask how much I'm willing to pay, what is a good price range?
# text = I saw a site that charges $0.70 per mile.
# text = Is that reasonable?
# text = Impossible to say, but I guess you would have to work out fuel consumption for the particular vehicle that they are using and pay a proportion of that, and some on top for the driver's time and effort, unless you are able to share transport with another or more, that would keep the costs down.
# text = Remember that you get what you pay for.
# text = Three hours isn't far, but you are doing multiple shows.
# text = Some people are willing to take your horse, but they really have old trailers that are not the safest in the world.
# text = Rusted, torn corners in the stalls, unhealthy air, straight load instead of slant load can all make travelling hard, if not downright dangerous, on your horse.
# text = I had my horse transported from CA to WA and he came on this big, open stock trailer.
# text = He was dehydrated when he got there and lost weight.
# text = Since then, I now use a professional horse hauling service with people who ride with my horse to keep an eye on him, stop every few hours for water, and their trailers all have super smooth suspension.
# text = All horses I've had delivered to me since then are happy and healthy when they arrive.
# text = I would call Bob Hubbard Transport and get a quote.
# text = Even though you may not want to use them, it will give you some idea of what it might cost and what is fair.
# text = See link below.
# text = Make sure the trailer service you use is bonded/insured and knows something about first aid.
# text = Do they have this anywhere?
# text = I want to take a cruise around the world.
# text = I mean literally around the world if possible.
# text = First of if i went alone on a regular cabin how much would you estimate it would be just a guess.
# text = Second is there any way to sort of customize the places you wanna go to?
# text = Like you can pick the destinations?
# text = But if not just say no but i hope there is like one out there somewhere.
# text = 1. Here's a site that lists world cruises including prices.
# text = http://www.cruisecompete.com/specials/regions/world/1
# text = Prices listed, however, are usually based on two people in a cabin, and you will likely face some high "single supplement" costs in addition.
# text = (Two people in a cabin will spend more onboard, so cruise lines charge you more to sail alone.
# text = You may be able to do better on the rates if you request competitive quotes via CruiseCompete).
# text = 2. Short of chartering your own ship and crew, I don't see any way you could customize your own itinerary.
# text = Good luck!
# text = Various world cruises from most of the major cruise lines, typically 100 days in duration.
# text = Travelling on your own you would have to pay double as cabins are sold on the basis of double occupancy.
# text = No possibility to customise ports of call.
# text = Prearranged about 18 months in advance as the cruise lines sell segments all along the way i.e Transatlantic to London (England), England to Barcelona (Spain), Barcelona to Alexandria (Egypt), Egypt to India via Suez canal etc.
# text = yes there are multiple around the world cruises, mainly offered by the more upscale lines.
# text = HOWEVER: you will pay as if there are 2 people in the cabin, even if it is just you.
# text = so any price you find, DOUBLE IT figure, $40K at least.
# text = and no you cannot customize an itinerary unless you book several different legs of a cruise with stops in between on shore.. say book a Panamal Canal crossing, then fly to Asia and pick it up again and sail to India then fly to Europe to sail the Med before flying to England to hit the Transatlantic corssing.
# text = Was the San Francisco Bay Area mostly Caucasian back in the early 1970s?
# text = No.
# text = There has been a large Asian presence in the SF Bay Area for a long time--the Chinatown here was the largest population of chinese outside of China, there were lots of Japanese who'd been displaced during WWII.
# text = The whole Western Addition and a large portion of the Haight was black.
# text = The Mission was basically latin-american.
# text = As the southeast asians and philipinos came over, they added to the cultures.
# text = So, the Bay Area has been fairly mixed ethnically for a long time--caucasians may have seemed to be a large populous but that's because most tourists back then were caucasian and many of the hippies were caucasians so that's who the photographers took pictures of.
# text = The other ethicities weren't well represented in politics yet--or rather, they were just breaking the color barrier in the 70's due largely to the more open-minded hippy generation.
# text = Marin County was predominantly caucasian and many of the expanding outer east bay areas started out as white suburbs.
# text = It was not so long after Civil Rights laws against discrimination started to have an impact.
# text = You never saw black MUNI drivers, Asian police, Latino politicians until then.
# text = It was an evolution.
# text = Many illegals were not counted in the population until the mid-80s.
# text = We did not have big percent of Chinese migration until the mid 90s.
# text = We had fewer people running across the Mexican border then.
# text = We had fewer social benefits at that time for people so many immigrants were not counted.
# text = Only Caucasians had any political power, corporate presence or owned businesses except for Mom and Pop stores in some neighborhoods.
# text = San Francisco was settled in the 19th and 20th century by mainly European immigrants except for some Asian workers who were manual laborers.
# text = There has always been a Mexican-American cultural influence since Calif was owned by Mexico.
# text = We had a larger black population in the 70s than we have now but they did not have any power until Willie Brown was elected.
# text = San Francisco was always progressive and welcoming and tolerant to all kinds of people historically.
# text = The counties outside San Francisco were more white than San Francisco in the 70s.
# text = EDIT: My memory may not be good so you might get a more accurate answer from someone else who remembers the time.
# text = Can rabbits and chickens live together?
# text = I am thinking about getting a rabbit as a pet, but my parents said that it has to stay outside.
# text = We also own two chickens that are kept in a run behind out garage/barn thing.
# text = There is already a little dog house that I would turn into a little rabbit hutch being kept back there and I was thinking about keeping the rabbit in the run with the chickens, but keeping the chickens in the coop and the rabbit in the hutch at night.
# text = However, in the day time would it be okay for the rabbit to hop around along with the chickens?
# text = We feed the chickens scraps of veggies and fruits throughout the day, but it's nothing that a rabbit wouldn't be able to digest just fine.
# text = So, can rabbits and chickens live together as long as they have separate places for their food and water?
# text = (The rabbit hutch would have an opening only big enough for the rabbit, the chickens would not be able to get to the rabbit food) Also, is it okay if the rabbit occasionally sneaks a few bites of chicken feed?
# text = My last rabbit did that a few times, and he was fine...
# text = I just wanna make sure :) Thank!
# text = Yes,but be sure that your chickens are all hens(I mean not roosters),Roosters may attack rabbits or anything they see moving,so be aware of that,hens are friendly with almost all kinds of pets!
# text = Be sure not to feed your rabbits non-veg items!
# text = You said they live in different cages and they are free in day,so no problem,don't put both of them in one cage because rabbits bedding is different than that of hens,wet bedding can cause diseases in them!
# text = So,don't put both of them in one cage.
# text = Good luck!
# text = yea i guess but rabbits a easily escape a pen or another rabbit could get in there and that rabbit could be the opposite gender.
# text = So be very careful and some feeds could be toxic to rabbits and safe for chickens.
# text = Rabbits do burrow also so don't be surprised if chicken are falling into holes.
# text = rabbits are delicate and can get diseases so watch out for that.
# text = melting brass did not work?
# text = my friends and I are trying to melt bras to make some little figures.
# text = we have made a furnace as such, we took a clay flower pot with a hole in the bottom put a piece of steel pipe in the middle of it with a cap on the bottom, filled the pipe with brass scrap, surounded the pipe with charcoal lit it off and pumped air through the hole in the pot, everything got red hot but did not melt.
# text = what am I doing wrong
# text = I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin, pewter, aluminum or zinc, they all have a much more reasonable melting point.
# text = I'll just echo both other answers.
# text = Molten brass is damn hot and usually it's pressurized gas and forced air or oxygen.
# text = Even if you did melt it, I doubt you foresaw the issues of handling it and pouring it.
# text = It's really too advanced for a beginner, both in tooling and safety.
# text = Just the zinc fumes will get you, if you don't take precautions.
# text = Pewter is perfect for what you are doing, and it melts on a stove top.
# text = I would recommend to start with something more simple like tin, pewter, aluminum or zinc, they all have a much more reasonable melting point.
# text = Brass has an even higher melting point than bronze and I would think your charcoal just doesn't get hot enough.
# text = I bet you also did take charcoal as it is used for barbecue which does not get as hot as real coal (e.g. for blacksmithing one needs coal, not barbecue charcoal).
# text = I have done a fair amount of metal casting, but never tried to build my own furnace, but I think your version is just too small and doesn't get hot enough.
# text = I have melted small amounts of bronze in a crucible with a large propane torch (much larger than the plumbers torch, but it can be run of those propane cylinders you can buy for a gas grill).
# text = I melt brass and cast it http://www.mikegigi.com/castgobl.htm
# text = Brass melts at just under 2000F which is a bright yellow heat, not red hot.
# text = http://www.mikegigi.com/techspec.htm#SELCTEMP
# text = You might be able to make a version of your setup work, but it would take quite a bit of charcoal and a lot of forced air.
# text = I use propane with a blower and a burner I built http://www.mikegigi.com/meltmetl.htm and http://www.mikegigi.com/firehole.htm
# text = Should all UK towns and their cafes or restaurants provide Halal food?
# text = Some friends of mine visited Dartmouth in Devon whilst on holiday last summer.
# text = They could not find any cafes or food shops that provided Halal prepared foods.
# text = Its important to their religion that they only consume Halal food.
# text = Even if you buy a cake in a bakers you can not be too what happens in the kitchen, for example the cake may have been sliced using a knife used for preparing ham.
# text = Its simply not just a case of avoiding pork, alcohol and only being allowed to eat halal prepared meat, but the kitchen and its utensils should not have been used for prohibited foods.
# text = Places like Dartmouth are supposed to be tourist towns and should provide foods for people of all religions.
# text = We all enjoy buying a snack when visiting a town or attraction while on holiday.
# text = Not everyone wants to bring packed lunch.
# text = Its not fair if some people have to go without buying food because no place will provide suitable food for them.
# text = I think its only fair that nowadays every town should provide at least one halal cafe or restaurant and hopefully one day every British catering establishment will be halal.
# text = When I went to Bosnia, all the meat was Halal.
# text = I will not eat halal meat, so guess what, I opted for foods which weren't a meat dish, there were plenty of other options.
# text = I could not go to their country and demand they slaughter and sell an animal as meat the way I prefer to eat it.
# text = When you go to another country, you live by their way of life and their laws, if you don't like it, you know how to get back out the country (but I guess our benefits system is too much to throw away, huh).
# text = No.
# text = To prevent animal cruelty, many countries forbid Halal and Kosher meat.
# text = Switzerland is one, and the Netherlands are passing the same law.
# text = It will become EU law in a couple of years.
# text = We can't dictate what business wants to open where.
# text = If someone thinks there is a business opportunity then they will start opening halal only places.
# text = How to convince my parents to let me get a Ball python?
# text = They don't know ANYTHING about Ball pythons.
# text = When I ask my mom she says she will never let a snake in her house.
# text = She has no experience with snakes and has never held one.
# text = I did all my research and am well prepared to keep one, I'm 14 by the way
# text = Lay some knowledge on them dude.
# text = Maybe if they see how much time and effort you've devoted to researching the animal they'll reconsider.
# text = Tell them it costs like 8 dollars a month (if even that much) to keep it fed.
# text = Be helpful around the house to show that even if you can't pay for it yourself that youre willing to work for it.
# text = Once you've buttered them up a bit try to get them to the pet store and ask one of the employees to handle the snake showing your mom how gentle and harmless they can be.
# text = Maybe even try to get your mom to hold it a bit.
# text = My wife was TERRIFIED of snakes when we first met, I introduced her to one out my baby corn snakes and she fell in love with it.
# text = Be persistent, but don't pester them about it cause that'll get you nowhere fast.
# text = Good luck!
# text = My general convince your parents to let you get a reptile advice:
# text = 1. Be responsible.
# text = Do all your chores without being nagged, take care of any existing pets, keep your room clean, and so on.
# text = Prove, to your parents' satisfaction, that you, not they, will be the one actually taking care of your new pet.
# text = 2. Save up, and research, so that you are ready for your new pet.
# text = 3. Bargain with them.
# text = Offer to do extra chores, ask for your pet as a reward for good grades, something like that.
# text = 4. Play the sympathy card.
# text = If you can find a pet at a shelter, or that a friend needs to get rid of because they're moving or whatever, you might be able to talk your parents into "giving it a good home" where you might not be able to talk them into buying a new pet.
# text = On the fear angle--talk her into coming to the pet store with you.
# text = Once you're there, ask if you can hold a ball python.
# text = Once you're holding it, try to get her to touch/pet it...
# text = My Snake's meal is TOO big, what can I do?
# text = Just today I bought a medium rat for my beloved Ball Python Salazar (name after Harry Potter).
# text = Last time I got a medium rat it was a girl and my snake handled her easily.
# text = But today, I got a boy and realized that he is HUGE!
# text = I really do love my snake cause she is actually an affectionate cold-blooded creature.
# text = So my true question comes to this, how can I knock the rat out?
# text = If I threw him against a wall and still conscious he will run away, do I hang him by the tail so the blood can flush into his skull?
# text = I really do need answers and advice, and NOT INSULTING ANSWERS!!
# text = LIKE SERIOUSLY!! >:(
# text = Best answer shall receive points :)
# text = Ok so if youre snake will take pre-killed, you can "gas it".
# text = Just put the rat in a sealed tupperwear container with no airholes and wait until it passes out and dies and then feed it.
# text = If it won't take pre-killed and you usually feed live then you could hold the rat by the tail and whack it against a hard surface, like a refrigerator or wall.
# text = I don't like that option though - I think it's pretty cruel and I'd not done properly you'll end up really hurting the rat but not stunning him enough to stop possible injury to your snake.
# text = I would do the tupperwear idea TBH - easiest and most humane.
# text = You could also just wait until the rat passes out for about 1 minute and them feed it - at this point, it could still have a bit of a heart beat and be slightly still alive.
# text = And also maybe try holding the rat in feeding prongs so your snake can get a good hold and grip on his prey.
# text = Good luck!
# text = Just my opinion here - no judgement - getting your snake on frozen/thawed will prove to be much easier for you and safer for your snake in the long run.
# text = My opinion - take it for what it's worth… :-)
# text = Looking to move to Toronto?
# text = I am a 20 something gay black male and I am looking for suggestions on neighborhoods close to the downtown Toronto area.
# text = Im moving from South Carolina so this will already be a huge culture shock.
# text = Any suggestions?
# text = Being gay and living in Toronto is just fine.
# text = You may consider the Gay Village on Church Street, right downtown.
# text = It is full of gay friendly "everything".
# text = For obvious reasons, knowing how extremely difficult it is to drive a car in the city, you should probably try to be near the subway system.
# text = But, can you immigrate?
# text = Being an American guarantees you no favours when it come to going to Canada.
# text = Start your process here, if you haven't already.
# text = (Marrying a Canadian is not enough - that doesn't count for at least two years.)
# text = http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/index.asp
# text = A normal processing time, unless you have an advanced degree or a "specified" skill is from 3 - 5 years.
# text = Coming to stay, and overstay your three months visit will lead to immediate expulsion and a lifetime ban to immigrate to Canada - NOT GOOD.
# text = Lets be clear about this...........
# text = Just 'wanting to come to Canada " is NOT enough.
# text = You MUST apply, to become a Immigrant, and WAIT to be approved, by the Canadian Government.
# text = YOUR education ( the more the better ) and your past work history, combined with a CLEAN FBI and State Police record, and a satisfactory financial history ( no bankruptcies or large outstanding debts in the USA ) are all taken into consideration.
# text = It is a competition, and YOU will be competing with hundreds of thousands of others, from all over the world, for a place in the line up.
# text = IF you have NOT begun the Application process's NOW< you are about 2 to 3 years away from being approved by Immigration Canada.
# text = So don't pack your bags ,yet.
# text = Being an American and from the "south " you will be noticed as soon as you speak out loud .
# text = Do it properly, and legally, and you will be OK.
# text = Jim B
# text = Toronto.
# text = How to train my puppy ?
# text = I have a 4 months Shih Tzu puppy.
# text = Recently I'm having trouble training him.
# text = He is kind of hate walking with leash, every time I put the leash on, he will try to bite it.
# text = And he is not following me when I was walking.
# text = I saw lots of videos about this, but actually it didn't help.
# text = Is there any way can let him know how to walk with leash ?
# text = He is really excited about anybody he see.
# text = How to prevent this ?
# text = Last thing is every time I sit on a chair or something higher than him, he will try to jump on, if he can't, he will bark all the time until I let him get on, what should I do with this ?
# text = Anyone have any suggestion?
# text = thank you very much.
# text = Hi, I am a dog trainer for 25 yrs.
# text = You need to purchase what is called a shoulder point harness.
# text = This type of harness goes around the dogs chest and legs and has a clip for the leash up on the back of the dog in middle of shoulder blades.
# text = This way, he cannot reach the leash to chew it.
# text = When he swivels his head to go for it anyway, tell him sharp "UH UH" gently correct him with a small tug and continue your walk.
# text = Do this repeatedly and frequently and he will learn to walk on a leash.
# text = Patience is the key here.
# text = He is a young pup and will learn over time and consistency in his training.
# text = And always, always train with love and positive methods- never hit or harshly scold.
# text = Never train out of fear.
# text = You want your dog to admire you as his pack leader, not fear you.
# text = Good luck with your puppy!
# text = All the best.
# text = Put him in dog obedience school or call a professional dog trainer. :)
# text = why dont you get some treats that he loves and only give him them when he does something right.
# text = or, as i saw on embarrassing pets on tv, get a clicker type thing and treats as well.
# text = try to train him to heel, which means to walk round you before he needs to go on a leash, and he may do that.
# text = or you could even spray some scented spray on the leash and he will go for the scent and probably, if you act quick enough, will stay on the leash.
# text = What sort of Hotel could I expect to find in New Delhi/Agra/Varanasi for rs500 per night?
# text = Hey guys.
# text = I'm looking to visit India with some mates at the beginning of February next year and I am wandering what standard of accommodation we could get for Rs 500 per person per night.
# text = There would be four of us so we would probably be looking at 2 twin rooms for Rs1000, close to the centre of these cities.
# text = This would be on a walk-in basis as we want to have the freedom of finding a place that looks good (Not relying on pictures from the internet) and is in a spot we like.
# text = Thanks in advance for sharing your experience!
# text = Sorry, almost forgot to ask - Would it be cheaper to walk-in to these hotels rather than pre book?
# text = In Delhi I'd recommend Ajay Guesthouse.
# text = Travelled to Delhi twice and stayed there twice.
# text = Rooms start from 500 per double.
# text = Those ones are quite small.
# text = Must say, in Delhi it's hard to get good price/quality rating.
# text = I have found this hotel in the Lonely Planet guide.
# text = It's in an area starting with a P, many tourist hotels there and the location is very nice.
# text = But in general, Delhi is the hardest place to find a nice clean hotel for that price.
# text = In Varanasi I don't know.
# text = I've stayed in a more expensive hotel there, but you can check some travelguides or tripadvisor?
# text = Also, while travelling ask people where they've been and if they have any hotel recommendations.
# text = In Agra I've stayed in a place fellow travellers recommended, they found it in the Rough Guide.
# text = It was nice and close to the Taj.
# text = It was quite easy to find something.
# text = (Dont stay in Agra too long.
# text = One night is enough!)
# text = There were many hotels there.
# text = Ive paid 500 for a double room there and it was fine and clean.
# text = Good luck, enjoy your time!
# text = You may find a normal budget hotel for Rs 1000 per night in the cities you mentioned, the links below may help you to find good hotels in Delhi and Agra.
# text = http://www.goldentriangleindia.com/delhi/hotels-in-delhi.html
# text = To Stay in delhi - Hotel Aster Inn is best to stay in delhi.
# text = it is in karol bagh.
# text = some beautiful locations like close to Karol Bagh Shopping Market, Presidential Palace, and Birla Mandir Temple and Connaught Place and Jantar Mantar are near to it.
# text = TO Stay in Agra -Hotel Atithi and Aditya Palace is perfect for you.
# text = it is centrally situated.
# text = To Stay in Varanasi - Sandeep Hotel is you choice...
# text = which one out of these makes the best pet?
# text = a degu, a rat, a mouse, a hamster or a guinea pig?
# text = and why is the one a better pet?
# text = Get a guinea pig.
# text = I have a hamster, and mice and rats like to escape.
# text = The Guinea pig is better because its a lot larger than a hamster, rat, mouse, or degu.
# text = So if you lose him, he is easier to find, because smaller rodents just LOVE to escape from their cages.
# text = So my opinion is Guinea pigs.
# text = (plus they dont stink that bad)
# text = Depends on what you want in a pet, to be honest.
# text = Also depends on the space you have, how much time you can handle the pet, how much money you can spend, etc.
# text = I've had experience with all of those pets except Degus.
# text = My favorite would have to be the rat.
# text = They're incredibly social, highly trainable, and very clean.
# text = Mine learned to "go to the bathroom" only in their cages and loved to ride on my shoulder or hang out in my hoodie pouch.
# text = The only downside is they should be kept in pairs or trios and require a pretty large habitat.
# text = That means expense, space, and they require weekly cage cleaning.
# text = My second favorite would have to be the Guinea Pig - not quite as social with people as rats (at least mine wasn't) but more so than most hamsters or mice.
# text = Again, pairs or trios and pretty big living space.
# text = They, too, need weekly cage cleaning and can cost quite a bit.
# text = I could handle my mice, but they where skittish and preferred their cage.
# text = I've never met a hamster that didn't bite me.
# text = Never had/handled a Degu.
# text = Get a guinea pig.
# text = We have two.
# text = They are social and like to be handled.
# text = You have to have two because they don't do well alone.
# text = Make certain you get two females.
# text = Two males can fight and you definitely don't want babies!!
# text = Guinea pigs (also called cavies) are gentle creatures and are awake during the day and sleep at night.
# text = They will whistle when they hear you as an encouragement for you to give them a treat like leaf lettuce.
# text = They love leaf or romaine lettuce and tomatos, celery, cucumbers, carrots.
# text = Don't feed them broccoli, cauliflower, garlic, onions, head lettuce ....they are all too difficult for them to digest.
# text = Also they can't eat potatos, they are toxic for them.
# text = If you keep the cage clean they don't smell and you can buy spray on cleaser for them, just massage it into their coat and groom them.
# text = Fostering 6 week old kittens and HATING IT!
# text = Need Advice!?
# text = I wanted to volunteer and help animals, and decided to try fostering kittens.
# text = This is my first experience and I have two six week old kittens right now and am at my wits end.
# text = I do not want to have to bring them back before they are eight weeks old but they are ruining my apartment.
# text = They track poop everywhere (most disgustingly my bed....), and am constantly trying to climb up everything, including my bare legs!
# text = My legs and hands are just full of scratches.
# text = I realize they are young and that cats do climb, but this is just ridiculous.
# text = My apartment also smells repulsive even though I am cleaning out their litter box at least once a day if not twice.
# text = Any suggestions and helpful hints to make this a more positive experience would be extremely appreciated.
# text = That's kind of the way it goes..lol.
# text = Limit them to one room with easy to clean flooring.
# text = If you have limited options, try the bathroom.
# text = Make sure there are plenty of litter boxes that are cleaned often.
# text = Depending on the batch of kittens, I will often have as many as one per kitten.
# text = They can produce a lot of waste and even scooping twice a day they can get messy.
# text = For some reason it takes them awhile to learn not to step in poop.
# text = Also if they have diarrhea, check in with your foster coordinator.
# text = They made need medication or deworming or something.
# text = They are testing out their claws and teeth.
# text = To some degree you can/should help teach them not to use their teeth and claws inappropriately.
# text = But in the meantime, highly recommend jeans and long sleeves anytime you'll be interacting with the kittens.
# text = Then take care of yourself.
# text = Get plenty of sleep and make sure you take time out to do some things you enjoy.
# text = Try visiting the kittens a few times a day for short periods of time.
# text = Try to go in there with the right frame of mind and enjoy them for what they are.
# text = If you still don't enjoy the kittens, see what other opportunities are available.
# text = They may need foster homes for adult cats in different situations.. sick, recovering from surgery, need a little socialization, etc.
# text = I find the adults are much easier.
# text = Generally they're not clawing and biting, they don't make nearly as much mess, they don't need nearly as much litterbox scooping, etc :)
# text = Decide volunteering is not your thing and give them back!
# text = And do more research before you agree next time ;-)
# text = Take the kittens back to the shelter.
# text = Maybe do volunteer work at the humane society, walk dogs, groom the animals etc.
# text = what r the requirements to apply for a delay birth certificate in canada?
# text = what r the evidentary requirements to apply for a delay birth certificate in canada?
# text = including fees and forms
# text = It depends on if you ever registered the birth.
# text = Some places do the registration right at the hospital....in some smaller places, you need to register your child's birth at the town hall/registrar's office.
# text = My first three children were born in Southern Ontario cities.
# text = The birth registration was done right in hospital.
# text = My last son, was born in Northern Ontario....
# text = I didn't know that I didn't register him in the ridiculous amount of paperwork I had filled out in the hospital and was supposed to go to city hall within 90 days.
# text = Two years later when I got around to filling for his birth certificate, I find out he was never registered.
# text = I had to call the Office of the Registrar General in Thunder Bay, have copies of the delayed registration form mailed out to me, as they don't have an online area for it yet, fill those out, send them away, then apply for his birth certificate.
# text = If you are just applying for a birth certificate for the first time, its simple to do it over the computer.
# text = For $56 you can even have it expedited and will get in three business days or your money back.
# text = This is in Ontario of course, the rates may be slightly different for other provinces/territories.
# text = You just need basic information, and answer a few questions like what hospital was the child born at/who was the doctor....
# text = they may then chose to ask you to bring more evidence, or just look up the record and hand you the certificate.
# text = You can probably do it all on-line.
# text = Start here if you were born in Ontario.
# text = http://www.ontario.ca/en/information_bundle/birthcertificates/119274.html
# text = If you were born elsewhere, start here.
# text = http://www.ontario.ca/en/information_bundle/birthcertificates/119275.html
# text = Good luck
# text = My parents didn't send for my birth certificate until I was 16 and needed it for summer employment.
# text = It was no problem to get PROVIDED the birth was registered in the first place.
# text = I add that in because there have been some people who have tried to claim citizenship by sending for their birth certificate when they were never really born in Canada or to Canadian parents.
# text = When a child is born in Canada the birth is registered before the baby can leave the hospital.
# text = As long as that was done you can send for it at any time.
# text = Each provincial government has a website that lists the process for that Province so depending upon where you were born you can google it.
# text = Royal Caribbean or Carnival cruise?
# text = ONLY IF YOU HAVE BEEN ON BOARD *BOTH* !!
# text = i want to know which you liked better and WHY?
# text = include which one had:
# text = -better food
# text = -more fun activities
# text = -more teens
# text = -AND JUST MORE STUFF YOU LIKED OVERALL
# text = please specify which royal or carnival ship (:
# text = Carnival and Royal Caribbean are two popular cruise lines that have strong followings.
# text = Some cruise aficionados refuse to sail on one or the other.
# text = Are there any major differences between them?
# text = Explore which cruise may fit your needs the best.
# text = For our comparison we sailed on two similar ships - the Carnival Liberty and the Royal Caribbean Mariner of the Seas.
# text = Itinerary Both ships go to Caribbean Islands like Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Cozumel, St. Thomas, the Bahamas and St. Martin / St. Maarten.
# text = The Liberty also visited its private island Half Moon Cay, Puerto Rico, and Grand Turk.
# text = The Mariner of the Seas traveled to its private island Coco Cay and Labadee (the north coast of Haiti).
# text = We loved most of the locations that both of the ships visited and don't believe that this should be a distinguishing factor on deciding between the cruise lines.
# text = Shows Each night there are a variety of shows.
# text = Usually you have the main show and some type of entertainment before and perhaps afterward.
# text = We felt that the main shows on the Mariner of the Seas were better.
# text = On the Liberty we liked the comedian and juggling act.
# text = If you love seeing the shows, Royal Caribbean was better for the main shows and Carnival was slightly better for the comedians.
# text = Dining Room We enjoyed the atmosphere of both dining rooms on the Liberty and Mariner of the Seas.
# text = We felt that the menu had a little more variety on the Mariner of the Seas.
# text = Friendliness of staff The Liberty and Mariner of the Seas both get high grades.
# text = We did have one waiter that complained some on one of our trips on the Mariner.
# text = We had a slightly better experience on the Liberty, but feel that both crews did an excellent job and that this should not be a distinguishing factor on choosing a cruise.
# text = Pools The Mariner of the Seas and Liberty both had salt water pools - which most cruise ships have.
# text = They both had pools for kids and adults.
# text = We liked the Liberty's pools better because one had a slide.
# text = If you have kids, this would be something that they would definitely enjoy.
# text = Spa We tried the spa on the Liberty and loved it.
# text = We did not try the spa on the Mariner of the Seas.
# text = Usually you can't go wrong when getting a spa treatment......
# text = Royal Caribbean is better, but the best cruiseline is Regent Seven Seas.
# text = Look on their website rssc.com
# text = Royal Caribbean.
# text = Carnival has been called the WalMart of cruise lines...
# text = What countries are the best to travel to?
# text = I really want to travel when I leave school!
# text = Where in the states could I go?
# text = Where in Europe?
# text = Have you every traveled before?
# text = How long should I go for to each place?
# text = (I Have 1 year before collage!)
# text = &Also how much money would I need?
# text = So I can start saving now hehe
# text = Thanks :)
# text = I mean when I graduate & yes, college, sorry for the typo.
# text = Leave High School?
# text = Not the smartest move to take off on a worldly adventure if you've never traveled before and you don't put where you would be traveling from.
# text = In the United States?
# text = Lots of places.
# text = There are 50 of them, 48 located from Maine to Florida and California to Washington State and all in between.
# text = There are 2 more located outside of the main continent with Alaska way to the north and Hawaii in the Pacific.
# text = What do you like to do?
# text = Big Cities like New York, Boston, Philadelphia on the East Coast.
# text = Beaches and Disney of Florida or the Mid Atlantic cities of Atlanta, Savannah, Charleston.
# text = The federal sites of Washington, DC.
# text = Southern charm of Nashville, Birmingham, New Orleans or Charlotte.
# text = West Coast hot spots like Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles or San Diego.
# text = Europe?
# text = Just as numerous as the possibilities of the US.
# text = Do you speak a foreign language?
# text = I could spend a year in Spain alone.
# text = From Madrid to Seville to Barcelona an Valencia.
# text = Bilboa on the north coast, Pamplona and the very famous Guernica.
# text = A road trip to Lisbon and the Algarve in Portugal before a mountain escape in the Pyrenees and a stop in Andorra before heading over to France and Italy and Austria and Switzerland.
# text = I've traveled to all of these places and could certainly tailor a trip to your needs based on budget, actual time allowed, your likes and dislikes.
# text = Amount of time could be dependent on so many things.
# text = Do you want to see all the sites or simply a few photos and on your way to the next place.
# text = Does your budget limit you to how long you can stay in each place?
# text = You need a lot of money for hotels, airfare, seeing the sites, food, local transport - you name it but life costs.
# text = Once you have a budget or an amount in the bank then you'll be able to figure out where you can go, for how long you can go and what you can do when you're there.
# text = 1 year before collage or college?
# text = Good luck.
# text = I recommend buying a single unlimited Europass and travelling anywhere in the EU your heart desires.
# text = You can't beat the price for what you get.
# text = come to Africa.
# text = Nigeria, a lovely country.
# text = But where in nigeria?
# text = Obudu cattle ranch.
# text = More than a tourist centre.
# text = How do you make your cat adjust to a new house?
# text = Me and my family are moving into a new house just outside a small town.
# text = We are currently living a mile from the town in a house surrounded by fields but the new house is beside a busy road.
# text = We have had the cat for 10 years and dont want to leave it.
# text = How could we make it settle in a new house.
# text = you are not just moving house - your cat is losing his territory.
# text = territory is very important to cats, and they are very nervous when they go into a new place - a new house could be full of predators, or unknown menaces - well at least he thinks so.
# text = you will need to give him only a small place to explore, so he can make it his territory, and feel safe there.
# text = then, he can have a place to retreat to when he feels scared.
# text = you will need to get his box and bowls, and whatever blanket and toys are his, and smell like home, and put him in a room.
# text = the room you sleep in is best (seeing you so relaxed that you are sleeping will send the message that everything is OK), but others will work just as well.
# text = close the door, and keep him in there for a week.
# text = he will feel much safer in that one room, than in a huge unknown house.
# text = he will explore the room, mark everything with his cheek, and try to make it feel like his territory.
# text = he will reassure himself that no other animal is in there, and that no other animal will come in - he is afraid that he is in someone else's territory when he is in a new house.
# text = in a week's time, he will have made it his, and will be getting more bored than afraid.
# text = let him out for half an hour, to explore.
# text = then put him back in.
# text = he will be freaked out, so going back to his territory will make him much happier.
# text = extend the time he is out each day, but for the first month, always put him in his room at night, so he feels safe to sleep.
# text = soon he will make the whole house his, but he needs that one safe place to start from.
# text = remember to visit with him while he is in the room, and tell him how good he is.
# text = remember to give him the time he needs to feel that the room is his - rush it, and he will be afraid of the whole house for a long time.
# text = he might even start peeing on things in fear.
# text = good luck with your new house and with his new territory!
# text = Let her explore when we moved my cat had to explore the entire house before she felt comfortable.
# text = In time though she/he will adjust. :)
# text = they just do it on their own.
# text = I just adopted a 2 year old male German Shepherd with Major bad behaviors?
# text = Last night, I adopted a 2 year old Male German Shepherd.
# text = (He is 92 pounds) He does not listen to any commands, but my major problem is that he will not go outside on command, or even with me.
# text = I will walk outside and he will stand at the door and stare at me or run away.
# text = My other MAJOR problem is that he will not get in his crate.
# text = I will get a treat and try to get him in there that way, it wont work.
# text = He wont even get close to the crate.
# text = If I come towards him, he will run away.
# text = How do I train him to feel comfortable in his crate?
# text = and to willingly go outside...and to come on command.
# text = He wont do anything on command.
# text = Its very frustrating.
# text = I have a 9 month old German Shepherd that I raised from a puppy.
# text = I trained her myself.
# text = She is crate trained, potty trained, and can sit, lay down, stay, come, fetch, and will even stay in a down position while I throw a treat across the floor or even right next to her paw, and she wont get it until I give her the command.
# text = Yes, lots of time and lots of patients...
# text = I just dont know how to do it with a grown dog.
# text = She tosses me around like its nothing!
# text = ...but basically, what I do is the same thing I did with my puppy...lots of patience, lots of time, lots of praise, lots of treats, and lots of repition....Right?
# text = Is there any tricks I could use?
# text = Maybe get a book on training.
# text = You have to be in command at all times.
# text = There are ways to get your new dog used to the crate or going out.
# text = I would start with a leash.
# text = Put the leash on the dog and just walk around the crate a few times.
# text = Then take the leash off and do nothing else but that.
# text = Later do it again.
# text = When the dog is ok with this, then open the door and walk around the crate, leave the door open all the time.
# text = Put something fun inside.
# text = Let your dog go in when he wants to for no reason.
# text = Do not shut the door.
# text = Let him walk in and out for a few days.
# text = At some point he will feel ok with this and you can then close the door but not for long at all.
# text = Open the door and let him out and see how he acts.
# text = If you push it, it will never work.
# text = With going outside, put the leash on and just take him for a walk.
# text = He will learn to really like this.
# text = Potty outside will come at some point.
# text = Try obedience classes.
# text = Have patience with him, you just got him and who knows how he was treated before you brought him home.
# text = where can I find the best tours to the Mekong Delta at reasonable prices?
# text = will only be in Ho chi Minh for 4 days and I am looking for a 1 day or 2 day trip to Mekong delta.
# text = or is it better if I wait till I get there?
# text = If I wait, would the tours I find there for less money be the same quality type tours?
# text = Also, any tour recommendations would be very helpful a well.
# text = Thank you!
# text = If you want reliable and inexpensive... try Sinh Cafe/Tourist.
# text = The are located right at 248 De Than St. in the heart of the back packer district.
# text = I have taken this tour and it was great.
# text = I did an overnight in a home stay that was sweet and the water market was wonderful.
# text = I don't remember the exact cost but remember thinking how inexpensive it was.
# text = Also, Sinh Cafe has been around for a long time and is very reputable.
# text = And no, I do not work for them. :)
# text = I am just a satisfied customer.
# text = And don't expect to party on this tour.
# text = The south is not like the regular tourist towns.
# text = Very few clubs and night activities.
# text = Oh, if you are confused.
# text = Sinh Cafe is not a Cafe.
# text = It is a tour agency and they have their own buses etc.
# text = tele#84838389593
# text = have fun.
# text = There isn't much to see in the delta, it's a lifestyle not a resort area.
# text = If you're adventurous you can take a bus or water taxi to My Tho (near where we live) or Can Tho.
# text = From either of those cities, you can venture out and spend a day in the country.
# text = Most of the tourists that I've come across buy tours along the My Tho waterfront.
# text = You take a boat across the river, then spend a day biking, eating at a local restaurant, buying souvenirs and doing other things that are geared towards tourists.
# text = The countryside is very beautiful, especially if you have a few months (or years) to get to know the place.
# text = PS, If you make it to Thanh Pho Ben Tre, stay a night at my friend Ken's hotel.
# text = It's called Kiwi Heaven and it's across the river from Cho Ben Tre.
# text = It's a little hard to get to by foot, they're rebuilding the bridge, but you can get someone to moto-taxi you there for a dollar or less.
# text = He's an ex-pat from New Zealand and he's been in town for awhile.
# text = He'll set up a real tour of the area for you, not some tourist fantasy.
# text = We went with Intrepid as a part of their North to South Vietnam Trip, but they do offer this one day separately.
# text = We had a great time and visited a location where they made coconut candies, visited a local restaurant which was attached to a fish farm, rode in modified quad bikes and had some tropical food at what appeared to be a local hangout.
# text = Intrepid is good at getting you away from the most touristy spots and showing you something a little different.
# text = yoga and horses.....?
# text = I got a riding lesson today on one of my boss's fino horses and it made me realize just how unsteady my left leg is.
# text = I mentioned it to my boss and she said to start doing yoga.
# text = But there are just so many poses and programs!
# text = Any good poses or programs (I'm willing to buy a dvd as long as it is under $20) to help specifically with leg stabilization?
# text = I just have a few issues supporting my back and my left leg flops.
# text = Because I don't feel like spending over $20 on a freakin DVD
# text = I also have back problems that transfer into my legs.
# text = Here is what I do now and it really helps....
# text = When I first get on I take 1 leg and pull it back up to touch my butt with my heel and hold it there for 1 lap at a walk around a large dressage arena.
# text = Then the same thing with the other leg.
# text = Then 1 lap at a walk around the arena with both my legs pulled out as far as I can, so they are not touching the saddle.
# text = Then a lap doing scissors, one leg forward as far as I can and the other back, then switch legs.
# text = I'll also trot doing, down 2 beats, up one for a wile, then up 2 down 1 making sure the weight is going into the balls of my feet.
# text = If the weight is going into your heels (it throws your leg forward) put the stirrups up against the heel of your boot.
# text = Do a nice working trot, not a slow trot.
# text = All this will help you use both legs evenly, keep proper contact and use your wight correctly, to keep your leg in a good position.
# text = BTW you dont want your leg locked in place, it will move WITH the horse a bit.
# text = When I first started doing it I'd do it every day.
# text = Now I just do it once or twice a week or as needed.
# text = Now not only is my leg better, but my back is relaxing.
# text = what are you having problems with?
# text = i wouldn't bother with yoga i'd practice more with riding and fixing my problem, ride bareback, with no irons, theres also a way to ride on your knees?
# text = that help alot with your thigh muscles (bareback though)
# text = ya i really wouldn't bother with the yoga
# text = maybe a back brase will help, sometimes my back really gets to me and i've thought about getting one.
# text = with your leg flopping, just try putting all your weight in your heel and hangon with only your legs, holding my leg back helps me with flopping the more it's forward the more it flops :/ work your calf muscles, maybe try standing on the edge of your steps (on the ball of your foot) and balance to strengthen those muscles
# text = You don't want to spend more than $20 and yet you have an expensive hobby like riding horses?
# text = I really can't help you.
# text = What to feed my dog after gastroenteritis?
# text = My dog has been sick for about 3 days now.
# text = He has been having diarheya everywhere and he began to vomit lastnight.
# text = I thought it would pass until he started to vomit blood and wouldnt drink any water.
# text = I took him to the Animal Hospital and they ran blood work and everything came back normal.
# text = No pancreatitis or anything abnormal.
# text = The vet said it was gastroenteritis and gave him fluids under his skin , an injection of nausea medication along with some take home antibiotics.
# text = So my question is..
# text = Is it normal for dogs to throw up blood while having gastroenteritis?
# text = and will these antibiotics help?
# text = I have tryed to give him water but he wont take it.. what should i do?
# text = i dont want him to get dehydrated and also should i try to give him a little bit of food?
# text = ... Some help would be great.
# text = thank you :)
# text = They didnt take x-rays they offered them but i just couldnt afford anymore treatment.
# text = I feel like shit for saying that but after what they have done already i wont be buying grocerys for the next few weeks.
# text = I will give them and call and see what they say.
# text = Thank you for the help.
# text = Ok so i spoke to the vet and he said the give him white rice and boiled chicken but only a little at a time.
# text = Seince he recieved the fluids lastnight he said not to worry about drinking water for at least a couple of days.
# text = I went home at lunch to check on him and he is doing 1000etter he was actually walkin around and wagin his tail :) thanks everbody for the info its greatly appreciated.
# text = To answer your questions in order:
# text = 1) It is not normal for dogs to be vomiting, much less to have blood in it.
# text = However, if they have been vomiting numerous times, then the blood could be due to irritation of the stomach and intestines.
# text = He could also have Parvovirus, a GI foreign body, or any number of things.
# text = Did your vet take radiographs (x-rays)?
# text = 2) Your vet would not prescribe them if they didn't think it would be helpful.
# text = 3) If he shows no interest in water, then take him back to your vet.
# text = It could be due to nausea or any number of things.
# text = He could become severly dehydrated (especially if he continues to vomit and have diarrhea).
# text = From there you end up with electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to heart and kidney problems.
# text = And being dehydrated, vomiting, and having diarrhea just doesn't feel good.
# text = 4) Call your vet.
# text = They should have discussed a bland diet with you, including the frequency of feeding and how much to feed at each sitting.
# text = It sounds like your dog may benefit from being hospitalized, and put on IV fluids to help his hydration, administer the antibiotics IV, and to ensure that he starts to recover.
# text = You should ABSOLUTELY call your veterinarian back immediately to clarify anything you have questions about.
# text = They have seen your pet, and are most aware of his condition.
# text = No one online will be able to assist you more than your vet can.
# text = You need to ask your vet these questions.
# text = Boiled WHITE rice and boiled chicken breast.
# text = Bland food.
# text = NO SPICES!
# text = My vet told me when a dog is vomiting a lot, it could be a sign of obstruction.
# text = Did they do any x-rays?
# text = I don't know if vomiting blood is common with this ailment.
# text = You should call your vet now and ask them what is normal or not.
# text = French dating etiquette?
# text = I would really love to hear what the French or those who had dated the French to say something about this.
# text = I'm in my 20's and currently studying in France.
# text = Coming from an anglo-saxon country my version of dating is 'getting the number, asking her out, etc..'
# text = However, I've read on the internet that the French dating etiquette is totally different.
# text = For them, dating would normally be meeting in groups or parties, then pairing off.
# text = In addition, from my understanding one-on-one dates is something that comes much later and not 'straight-away' like us anglo-saxons.
# text = They are also very secretive about being in a relationship.
# text = They only 'go out in the open' once they have reached a certain level of seriousness.
# text = Is it true?
# text = I have told a French girl I liked her, and she accepted.
# text = She is friendly when we see each other on campus.
# text = She is also nicer when we are both alone.
# text = However, when we are at parties or when they are people around she seems to ignore me.
# text = She also seems to hate it whenever I ask her out on a date, to the point she said stop!
# text = My mind thinks she has no interest in me and just stringing me along.
# text = But the articles I read seemed to say the contrary.
# text = Have I just fallen victim in a cultural trap?
# text = What you have read in the internet is fairly accurate but of course it does not fit all scenarios.
# text = You are not French for a start, so the "rules" or "customs" may not apply to you when it comes to entering into a relationship between people from different backgrounds.
# text = From what you say the messages given by this girl are quite clear.
# text = She is not stringing you along since she is actually discouraging you and is honest enough to tell you to stop asking her out .
# text = She is just being friendly in public because she does not want to offend you and she treats you like any other friend.
# text = You said you liked her and she accepted it as a truth and perhaps as a compliment, but it does not mean she fancies you or wants to pair off with you.
# text = At parties she does not want to be considered in any way attached to you, which is consistent.
# text = Take the messages for what they are: she has no objection in you being pals at uni, but she does not want to take matters further.
# text = "Non!" means "non", not "I might consider it, and I will keep you attached to my apron strings just in case."
# text = Christiane gave you a good answer.
# text = You have fallen in a cultural misunderstanding.
# text = What I have to add is that it is normal in France to have mixed gender groups of friends, there's nothing unusual in boys and girls being only friends, which is obviously what this girl wants from you.
# text = She probably finds your company pleasing as a friend but you are not her choice a a boyfriend and she is trying to keep it on a friendship level, and trying to make you understand that she doesn't want to go further.
# text = If she is nicer when you are alone I'd say it is because in public view she is making sure that people do not think that you might be her boyfriend.
# text = You do find the 'get the number hop in bed with her' but be aware that they usually have a reputation as sluts.
# text = Unfair for the girl as boys don't have that kind of handicap, but that's the way our own rules work.
# text = Should have done research before you left.
# text = Why not just take your chances and do it your way?
# text = True or false: being a young New Zealander means having no future?
# text = There are no jobs in this country.
# text = I'm just trying to make up my mind whether I should move to Australia or seek work in the sex industry.
# text = Is there a future for our nation's youth?
# text = @Ryan B,
# text = I'm two years into an undergraduate degree.
# text = Everybody I know at university intends to stay at uni for as long as possible until there are actually jobs available.
# text = Everybody seems to flee this country and move overseas, to Australia, etc.
# text = There's obviously a reason for that (lack of employment, low incomes, etc.)
# text = Your answer doesn't do anything but remind me that I'm going to be $25,000 in debt by the time I'm 22.
# text = So, thanks.
# text = @W.a.b.b.y,
# text = I really like you're answer.
# text = it's very logical.
# text = I've also considered becoming a teacher, but it's not a job I'm cut out for.
# text = I also wish I'd applied for a scholarship.
# text = I didn't think I'd be awarded one, but I received the Dux Litterarum award at high school, so my chances were probably better than I thought they were.
# text = Obviously I'm still completely stupid though.
# text = I mean, I wasn't smart enough to apply for a scholarship.
# text = And yes, I am being melodramatic.
# text = Lol.
# text = @Hatmanone,
# text = *gasps* So I wouldn't make a good prostitute?
# text = Are you saying I'm bad in bed?
# text = How would you know?
# text = Joking.
# text = Your answer is very sweet, but I'm not compassionate towards teenage high school students.
# text = In my opinion, far too many people are at university studying worthless degrees.
# text = Yes things like philosophy and fashion design are interesting, but how many jobs are out there for someone with these qualifications?
# text = I'm studying to be a teacher, so I know that there will definitely be jobs out there when I'm done.
# text = I may have to live somewhere rural or in Auckland, but at least I can be pretty sure I'll be employable.
# text = I've also got a bachelors degree so I can go back and do further study or take a different profession.
# text = I also know that you don't get paid that much more in Australia than you do here.
# text = And it's not all about how much you earn, cost of living is much higher in many cities in Australia.
# text = Try living in Sydney on a teacher's salary, then compare it to somewhere like Central Otago.
# text = You also have to put up with all the annoying accents in Australia.
# text = It's probably not a wise idea to keep studying and having a massive student loan.
# text = At the moment there's no interest, but that'll probably change.
# text = And they'll probably add interest to what you've already racked up.
# text = And they're working towards being able to extradite people who have left the country to avoid paying it back.
# text = At the moment if you move overseas you can only come back to New Zealand for a short amount of time before they'll force you cough up.
# text = And all that time you're overseas you'll be racking up interest.
# text = I wouldn't like not having the option to return to NZ.
# text = I guess I'm extremely fortunate that I received a scholarship which paid about 800f my course fees through my degree.
# text = But I worked hard and I'm still working hard.
# text = There are far too many lazy people out there who think that they can sit around a job will fall in their lap.
# text = My 2c. ....
# text = Get an education!
# text = I'm doing fine.
# text = Whilst youth jobs are thin on the ground, don't assume it's better in Oz.
# text = People have been fleeing this country at roughly a plane load per week for the past 20+ years, so it's not anything new.
# text = It depends on what you hunger for.
# text = 700f jobs aren't advertised.
# text = That means making yourself known; that means networking.
# text = why does my baby king snake refuse to eat?
# text = i have a baby eastern king snake.
# text = i have tried EVERYTHING i can to get him to eat but he refuses.
# text = he has a great environment, with water and lots of hiding places and a heat lamp.
# text = as far as i know, everything is as good as it can be where his aquarium is concerned.
# text = according to the vet, he is healthy and looks good.
# text = he has been going to the bathroom like he should.
# text = (i know that snakes that have problems going to the bathroom won't eat.)
# text = he has been drinking water (i am pretty sure he has been drinking it out of his bowl, but also i have been feeding him water and he doesn't ever give me a problem with that - i just stick his head near the water and he sucks it down.)
# text = i handle him every few days.
# text = he is feisty, as most king snakes are, but he is a very nice little guy - he never tries to bite or anything.
# text = i just love him to death.
# text = i don't know why he won't eat though!
# text = i have tried feeding him 5 or 6 live pinkies and 4 or 5 frozen (thawed) pinkies.
# text = i have never tried feeding him a pinky that was bigger around than he is.
# text = i have tried putting him in a small container and putting him in a dark place for an hour or so and he won't touch the pinky.
# text = he crawls on top of them but does not try to eat them.
# text = he doesn't seem to know that they are food.
# text = i have tried "braining" both live and dead pinkies, and bloodying them up to get his attention, but he doesn't care.
# text = i have tried dipping both live and thawed pinkies in tuna juice, and in used gerbil bedding.
# text = i have bought some long reptile feeding tweezers and have tried holding the pinky in front of the snake's face.
# text = he wont even try to bite.
# text = i am very discouraged and sad and i don't know what to do.
# text = he hasn't eaten in an entire month.
# text = i've only tried to feed him one at a time.
# text = he's just a tiny baby, about the width of a pencil.
# text = do babies this small hibernate?
# text = When you feed him how many pinkies do you feed him?
# text = If you feed him too many he could just not be hungry.
# text = If he doesn't seem interested in them at all I would say he's just not hungry.
# text = My boyfriend has one and when she's hungry she attacks the pinkie right away.
# text = They can smell it so i'm sure he knows what it is and just don't want it.
# text = Remember snakes can go awhile without eating.
# text = In the winter, they will usually go deep underground and enter a hibernation-like state called brumation, which is characterized by a slowed metabolism and reduced activity.
# text = King snakes sometimes stop eating, particularly during the cooler part of the year.
# text = They have a natural instinct to hibernate.
# text = If the snake is not pregnant or shedding, and its enclosure is properly equipped, a loss of appetite probably signals a beginning of hibernation.
# text = Hibernation is natural, and a necessity for snakes that are going to be bred.
# text = Another thing that can cause a king snake to stop eating is shedding.
# text = You can tell when your king snake is about to shed, because its eyes will get milky looking.
# text = Its body will be dull looking, too.
# text = In a few days the snake will begin to shed its skin.
# text = For example, some snakes will routinely go off their food in both the summer and winter, feeding mainly in spring and fall.
# text = It's natural and so long as you don't see any serious deterioration in their health is nothing to worry about.
# text = You see, some snakes for no obvious reason will simply go off their food.
# text = They're fit and healthy and their care is suitable.
# text = hope this helped.
# text = That's why it's good to have a python!
# text = It's twice my size and eats a rabbit once a month.
# text = are my two cats fighting or playing?
# text = how rough is too rough?
# text = help!?
# text = i have a 1 and a half year old male neutered cat and a new 2 month old spayed female kitten.
# text = the first night i brought her home i did the sniffing under the door thing and left it at that.
# text = the next day i let her out of the bedroom so they could check each other out, and the kitten hissed twice within the first 20 minutes of meeting each other and now she no longer hisses and they have been playing(chasing each other up and down the hall, rolling around on the ground and pawing at each other).
# text = only once it looked like my male cat was biting at her neck and then her stomach and she was meowing fairly loud and hissed once then he backed off and now they are fine.
# text = were they roughhouse playing?
# text = or were they actually fighting?
# text = he has been "biting" at her neck and stomach previously while they play without her meowing or anything so im wondering if he went a little to far that one time.
# text = any answers help!!!!!!
# text = you did not leave the new kitten in the room long enough.
# text = you need to do that for a least a week, or else this type of territorial fighting will happen.
# text = giving the new kitten her own small territory will help her to feel safe and will give her a place to go to when scared.
# text = right now, your male is fighting off an intruder, and he feels that all of the house is his.
# text = put her back in the room, and keep the door closed for a week.
# text = then let her out for ten minutes.
# text = make it fifteen the next day, then twenty, and so on.
# text = this will do two things; the new kitten will rub her cheek on the furniture in her room, making it her territory.
# text = she will start to calm down and feel safe - you can bet she doesn't now.
# text = she will be able to sleep without being afraid.
# text = as well, your male will be able to see that his territory is not threatened.
# text = when the door opens, he will get that the one room is hers, and he will be OK with that.
# text = the territory thing will be solved.
# text = your male is hurting her to put her in her place - biting her scruff is dominance and biting the belly is a move cats use when hunting - to pull the guts out of their prey.
# text = this is not good.
# text = give them time to set up their territories, and once you bring the new kitten out, pay a lot of attention to the male.
# text = you have brought someone else into his territory, and he needs to be reminded that you still love him, and support his claim to his space.
# text = that will help to reassure him, and he will be less aggressive with her.
# text = when they play fight, they don't hiss.
# text = if they hiss, they are not playing.
# text = if they bite, and one cries, you must separate them, and you must keep an eye on them.
# text = hissing is OK, unless they start to fight.
# text = if that happens, separate them, and give them time apart.
# text = putting the girl in her territory will make her feel less afraid, and she will relax.
# text = good luck!
# text = A hiss is basically a "get the f*ck away" sound.
# text = It means they've gone too far.
# text = When they start bleeding that means they're really fighting.
# text = If they're going kinda slow and like fake biting (not biting as hard as they can), and fake scratching (not hitting as hard as they can with their paws) then they're playing.
# text = I have two cats, and at first they hissed at each other because cats are very territorial, but now they do fight and play.
# text = The difference is when the cat hisses, that means they are annoyed and they want the other cat to go away.
# text = That means they are fighting.
# text = When they are just jumping at each other and their tails are wagging that means that they are playing.
# text = I can see how you get confused though. :)
# text = What was the goal for North Vietnam in the Tet offensive?
# text = When Johnson deployed troops in 1964 he was advised by the military it would take a half-million troops about ten years to pacify South Vietnam.
# text = He refused to believe them and ordered the military to win the war within two to three years (before the next election in 1968).
# text = He did not give them the number of troops they requested.
# text = This left Westmoreland with few options, so he adapted a Search and Destroy strategy instead of a Clear and Defend strategy which is, in the long run, the preferred method of pacifying an insurgency.
# text = Thing is, it worked.
# text = The ARVN was not having a big problem with the Local VC (the guerilla movement), they were being challenged by the Main Force VC (which was light infantry) and the North Vietnamese Army (NVA).
# text = When the Americans swept in with their Search and Destroy operations the Communists quickly leaned they could not stand up to the US firepower, and these regular troops were forced to flee the country and take sanctuary across the borders in Laos and Cambodia.
# text = All those sunny reports about the progress in Vietnam were correct, the Communists WERE being defeated.
# text = However, Johnson would not let the military cross the borders and clean out the Communist bases.
# text = He was warned that they were building up a huge Army and would eventually launch an attack, but he ignored his military advisers.
# text = The Communists agreed.
# text = They could not defeat the Americans.
# text = However, what they hoped to do during the Tet Offensive was to sneak past the Americans and attack the ARVN in the urban areas where they were deployed doing successful Clear and Defend operations.
# text = The Communists thought they could defeat the ARVN, cause the fall of the South Vietnamese government, and the people would than rally to the Communist cause and leave the Americans stranded in a sea of angry peasants.
# text = THAT WAS THE PLAN.
# text = What happened?
# text = The Americans detected the attempt to infiltrate the urban areas and were already redeploying troops from the rural areas.
# text = The ARVN rushed back from holiday leave and counterattacked.
# text = Within 24 hours every Communist assault had been defeated except in the ancient capital of Hue.
# text = The government did NOT fall.
# text = And the South Vietnamese people?
# text = When give the ultimate choice, they rallied…
# text = TO THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT….
# text = Tet was a huge military and political disaster for the Communists.
# text = They were chased back into Laos and Cambodia with the ARVN in hot pursuit.
# text = The people rejected their attempt to topple the government, and for all intents and purposes the US military (and the ARVN) handed Johnson the victory he had ordered them to achieve within the time-frame he ordered it.
# text = All he had to do for a complete victory was allow the military to go into Laos and Cambodia and finish off the shattered Communist forces.
# text = But Johnson was so obtuse he didn’t understand he had a victory when it was handed to him on a silver platter.
# text = Instead he pulled the military off, stopped the bombing of North Vietnam, withdrew from the presidential race, and spent the rest of his term in office trying to surrender to North Vietnam.
# text = They screwed up by not accepting his surrender when he offered it.
# text = The American people were NOT having any of it, and elected Richard Nixon to fix the mess LBJ had made (not to surrender like the antiwar movement was demanding).
# text = In the end Nixon kept his promise for “…peace with honor….”
# text = But that’s another question.
# text = To emancipate the south, but it was a serious failure.
# text = To make the war unpalatable to the American public.
# text = In that, they pretty much succeeded.
# text = Before Tet, the war was unpopular but tolerable to the majority of Americans in that the loss of American lives was seen as the cost of subduing the VC and NVA.
# text = Tet made it clear that the war was a long way from being over if the Americans thought they could preserve the South and that the North was perfectly willing to suffer great losses to continue their fight.
# text = There is a very good book on the subject that was written by General Vo Nguyen Giap.
# text = Try google to find the title if you would like to read it.
# text = Bearded dragon question...?
# text = I just bought a baby one yesterday.
# text = I have a basking spot lamp that says it is a double reflector that focuses 35% more light/heat and provides beneficial UVA rays important to the psycholical well-being of him.
# text = My question is does that mean it gives him not only the heat, but the "sun rays" he needs?
# text = I also was wondering how long should this light be on.
# text = The lady at pet smart said 4 hours, but on places on the net it says 10 to 12 hours.
# text = He's getting used to his new home, but hasn't eatin yet.
# text = I have bearded dragon juvenile food and freeze- dried crickets.
# text = Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
# text = Thank you for your time.
# text = Let me try to break this down as simply as I can: diurnal (active during the day time) reptiles like the bearded dragon require 3 types of "light," UVA, UVB, and heat.
# text = Any white light emitting light source will emit UVA, including heat bulbs, that's the easy one to provide for.
# text = UVB on the other hand can only be reproduced by a fluorescent source.
# text = UVB will always be a separate bulb from the heat lamp, unless you use a MVB (mercury vapor bulb) which is the only reptile use bulb that will emit both UVB and heat from one bulb.
# text = I highly recommend that you do not use coiled/compact UVB bulbs as they are known to cause severe eye damage and/or blindness in reptiles not to mention they have trouble maintaining UVB output over time.
# text = The long tube UVB bulbs are best, like Zoomed's Repsitun model: http://lllreptile.com/store/catalog/reptile-supplies/uvb-fluorescent-lights-mercury-vapor-bulbs/-/zoo-med-24-repti-sun-100-fluorescent-bulb/ Remember to replace UVB bulbs according to the manufacturers recommendation after which time the bulb will no longer produce UVB even if visible light still is.
# text = So, to answer your question, no, if you just have a bulb that says it produces UVA then you do not have "the sun's rays" that your bearded needs.
# text = You need to also provide a source a UVB lighting.
# text = The person at Petsmart is very wrong; in fact it is always a good idea to second guess what most pet store employees tell you; they don't have the best track record regarding giving reliable pet care info.
# text = UVB and basking temp (should be about 110 F for a baby, 95 F for an adult) should be available for 10 - 12 hours a day.
# text = Freeze dried food is not a good staple food source; you need to offer live feeder insects.
# text = Bearded dragons are sight hunters, they need to see the food move to trigger a feeding response, especially when they are babies.
# text = Live food is also higher in nutritional value than freeze dried.
# text = Crickets, silk worms, phoenix worms, and various feeder roaches, like red-lobster, turkistan, and dubia, are good example of staple insects to offer your bearded.
# text = Wax worms and meal worms should only be offered as treat items, for variety's sake.
# text = I would highly recommend that you read through some reliable bearded guides to make sure you have everything set up correctly:
# text = http://herp-info.webs.com/beardeddragon.htm
# text = http://www.beardeddragon.org/articles/caresheet/?page=1
# text = mm it depends on the size of his tank or cage or whatever you have him in..atleast as far as i'm concerned.
# text = if there are shady areas he can move to (for example a 3x5x4 tank with light on one side) then you can leave it on a full 12-14 hours, if its a small tank and he can't escape the light then 4-6 at most at a time though quite possibly 4-6 hours at a time twice a day.
# text = either way you also need to keep an eye on the temperature if you are using a dry fish tank as UV lights in my experience up the temperature significantly and without proper ventilation it can become an oven.
# text = as to what the light provides it gives UV rays..which is important for health in lizards as it is in humans.
# text = That lady at PetSmart is a disgrace to the rest of us PetSmart associates... sheesh.
# text = Yes, it gives him the "sun rays" necessary, that's what UVA is.
# text = And it should be on 10-12 hours, just like the sun would be up for 10-12 hours in his natural environment.
# text = As for the heat, just be sure to use a thermometer.
# text = Also, Beardies often do not eat food that is not moving, so its anyone's guess whether or not he'll touch the freeze-dried crickets or the processed food.
# text = I tell all my customers they can try it, but don't count on it.
# text = Also try green leafy veggies, like kale and spinach.
# text = Best of luck!
# text = Is a finch or a parakeet better?
# text = I am making a christmas list for my parents and i was going to ask for a bird and these are the affordable ones that i like, and i was wondering : which would not bite alot, and which are more fun to have as pets AND I NEED TO KNOW WHICH WOULD BE QUIETEST i honestly dont care but my family does !
# text = Please help me!
# text = oh and please say y one is better thx!!!!!!
# text = Hi there,
# text = Please choose the parakeet...
# text = Heres my reason.....
# text = I did the same thing that you did for christmas.
# text = I ended up getting a pair of zebra finches for christmas.
# text = At first it was all cool and all.
# text = After a couple of weeks I got tired of them.
# text = They are quite messy and you cannot hold or pet them.
# text = Ive tried to tame them and they just would not get tamed.
# text = They dont want to be held or touched.
# text = I want a bird that I can hold and do tricks.
# text = I still have them and they are doing well.
# text = A couple of months after I got parakeets/budgies.
# text = They are adorable they have beautiful colors and personality.
# text = I love them.
# text = First of all they are very tame.
# text = I tamed them in 4 days.
# text = They can do tricks and they arent messy.
# text = The whole family loves them.
# text = My parents even plays with them.
# text = They are a big part of our family.
# text = I hope this helps you with your decision.
# text = They are both about the same noise level.
# text = When choosing a parakeet look for a young one.
# text = (the younger the eaiser to tame) Look for clean smooth feathers, beak, and clean vent feathers (the feathers around the butt..dirty vent feathers means the bird is not healthy) Look for a dark eye with no circles (the older ones have a circle ring in their eyes).
# text = Look for a lot of stripes in their head that starts from the beak and goes back to the back fo the bird.
# text = the stripes are like hair the less stipes the older.
# text = (think of a balding man lol) Look for clean feathers.
# text = If you want a boy the cere (the nostrils piece above the beak) must be blue.
# text = The girl has either pink or brown.
# text = I would recommend that you get two parakeets.
# text = But get either one male and one female, or two males.
# text = Do not get two females.
# text = They sometimes dont get along (you know how some girls are lol hahahaahh but for real though, two girls tend to fight a lot.
# text = I have one yellow girl and a green and yellow boy.
# text = They are the best!
# text = If you choose to get a parakeet this is a trick that I used to tame them.
# text = However if you plan on getting one, then get more than one at the same time they need company.
# text = My mom told me how to tame them and I was very happy with the results.
# text = It took me 4 days to get the new one to be able to step on and eat out of my hand.
# text = These are the steps I used.
# text = Honestly they have worked for me twice with my parakeets.
# text = Hopefully they will work for you.
# text = 1) When you get the bird, place him or her or them in the cage.
# text = Leave them in there with food and water and such for about 2 hours.
# text = 2) Then place you hand in the cage.
# text = I took the cage and place it next to the couch.
# text = Then I sat on the couch, placed one hand in the cage, holding a millet spray.
# text = (this way the will associate your hand with food, and birds love food lol) Then I turned on the tv and watch.
# text = This way they will see that your hand is good and its not going to grab them or hurt them.
# text = Do this for about one hour.
# text = (you can take breaks if you have too) and repeat the steps after about 2 hours.
# text = 3) After about day 2, they will start to eating the millet spray from your hand.
# text = (do not take away the food dish from the birds, they will associate you as the person who takes away their food)....
# text = Then take your finger and place it under their belly, in front of their feet and say up.
# text = Push you finger to their feet gently and say up.
# text = ( the first couple of times they will fly all over the cage but as long as you dont jump back or screem they will get used to you) They will have no choice but to go on your finger.
# text = When they see that you arnt harming them, the will go up on your finger when you say up.
# text = 4) If they are not going up by now you just gotta keep trying and keep trying.
# text = Do not hit, yell, or harm them.
# text = You have patience.
# text = Dont give up!
# text = After a couple of weeks mines knows when I say shoulder it means ot go on my sholder, when I say up it means to jump up on my finger, when I say up and out it means up on my finger and out of the cage.
# text = and when I say go home it means to go in the cage.
# text = Good luck!
# text = They worked for me and I hope they worked for you!
# text = They are awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# text = And thats my reason why you should choose a parakeet over a finch.
# text = a parakeet is friendlier
# text = Parakeet.
# text = They are normally quiet and it is easy to take care of them.
# text = They are also friendly.
# text = I have a parakeet named Cookie . :P
# text = When is the best time to travel to Ireland?
# text = My sister and I would like to go to Ireland.
# text = I graduate in the spring, and so we'd like to go between then and winter.
# text = We don't want too many tourists, and since we'll both be out of school we can go anytime between the middle of June to early November.
# text = We don't want it to be too cold (not sure when exactly there fall is... or what the weather is really like there during our autumn months), but we don't feel like we need to go right in the middle of summer either.
# text = We're both in our early 20s and just wanting to explore the beautiful country while we're still young and before our lives start to get even crazier!
# text = Can anyone give me an idea of when the best time for us to go to Ireland would be?
# text = People do not go to Ireland on holiday for the weather, it is unpredictable.
# text = One thing you can be sure of about Irish weather is how little you can be sure of.
# text = It may be shirtsleeves and sunglasses in February, but winter woollies in March and even during the summer.
# text = And then there’s the rain.
# text = Ireland receives a lot of rain, with certain areas getting a soaking as many as 270 days of the year.
# text = County Kerry is the worst affected.
# text = The southeast is the driest, enjoying a more continental climate.
# text = The Irish weather works on the ‘four seasons in a day’ principle, which basic­ally means that you can’t predict a thing when it comes to the behaviour of the sky.
# text = Some basic assumptions, however, can be made.
# text = In summer, from May to July, the days are reasonably warm and – most importantly – very long: at the height of summer you won’t need to turn on lights until after 10pm.
# text = It is also peak tourist season, which means there are far more people just about everywhere but the most remote corners of the island, and prices are at their highest.
# text = Not surprisingly, most of the yearly festivals occur during these times so as to take advantage of the crowds and the more favourable weather.
# text = Spring (February to April) and Autumn (August to October) make good alternatives, although the country’s ever-growing popularity as a tourist destination can often blur the lines between mid- and high-season tourism.
# text = Still, you have a better chance of some peace and quiet, and the weather can be surprisingly better in April and September than in mid-July – again, it’s all part of the uncertainty principle.
# text = Spring festivities include the ever-popular St Patrick’s Festival.
# text = Although temperatures do not often venture below freezing, winter (December to February) can be brutal, for huge parts of the country – the west and northwest in particular.
# text = Crowds are at their thinnest, but many of the country’s tourist attractions and services close down in October and don’t reopen until Easter, which paradoxically leaves visitors with a more convincing taste of how Ireland is experienced by most of the Irish: it’s cold, grey and dark by 5pm, but there’s always a pub to escape into when the rain starts sheeting down.
# text = The thing to do is to bring the right clothing with you, clothes so you can layer up if it is cold and take off layers when it warms up.
# text = Waterproof clothing and footwear are essential plus an umbrella..
# text = As that famous Scotsman Billy Connolly says "there is no such thing as bad weather just the wrong clothes"
# text = Afraid I cannot be more helpful, it is really a case of pot luck, although as the weather is so changeable often a cold wet morning will turn into a lovely warm sunny afternoon and evening or visa versa.
# text = If you mean the Republic of Ireland (Dublin) then anytime.
# text = The summer there is much more mild than most of the US (are you coming from the US?).
# text = Their seasons are the same as all the countries in the Northern Hemisphere but I would suggest fall.
# text = It does get pretty cold in Ireland so going before winter is your best bet.
# text = September for example.
# text = Rent a car and spend a couple days outside of Dublin seeing the countryside and you will have the trip of a lifetime.
# text = To explore the beautiful countryside you will need to be old enough to hire a car because public transport is expensive & only goes as far as the main towns/cities, most rural places don't have a bus or train service.
# text = You could stay in a city & get a bus tour to say the Cliffs of Moher or Dingle peninsula but you will be with all the other tourists.
# text = By definition most tourists will go to the best places so you might have to put up with a few tourists along the way.
# text = Best weather the past couple of years has been around late April - late May but it can pour with rain for days on end at any time of the year so be prepared with waterproof jackets/boots etc.
# text = We only had a few sunny days this summer, barely 24C on a few occasions, more like 14C most days.
# text = We used our BBQ on precisely 4 occasions.
# text = Autumn is from mid August onwards as far as the weather goes if not officially according to the calender.
# text = The days start to shorten & it gets even wetter, windier & colder.
# text = We had frosts in October so I wouldn't advise visiting late in the year to be honest, Spring time is your best bet.
# text = You do realise it is quite expensive to visit Ireland?
# text = You are going to need a few thousand dollars saved up for flights, insurance, food, accommodation & spending money.
# text = Eating out in particular is quite expensive compared to America I believe.
# text = Golden Wonder KilliFish Breeding Help?
# text = I have 4 Golden Wonder Killifish.
# text = 1 of them is really colorful and is about 6cm long.
# text = 2 of them are kinda whitish and are about 4-5cm long.
# text = The last one is colourful too but it is about 4cm long.
# text = I feed them Flakes, and Live Earthworms uncut everyday.
# text = Can you tell me the whole process of breeding them and taking care of the babies?
# text = Thanks in Advance.
# text = Wow!
# text = If they are able to take earthworms uncut, that is really impressive!
# text = I aspire to your feeding regime, flakes early and something live later in the day.
# text = Worms (and Daphnia) are also rich in Lipids, substances important in forming eggs and growing young.
# text = I think that you understand that your largest and smallest golden wonders are males.
# text = If you would like more on sexing out Aplocheilus lineatus take a look at the discussion in the first source below.
# text = If you have plants in your tank.
# text = your lineatus are already spawning.
# text = If conditions are favorable (78-82 F) and the fish are obviously well fed as yours are, they will spawn.
# text = (I've even had a pair of killies leave eggs on a floating thermometer!
# text = If you wish to pick eggs make a acrylic spawning mop.
# text = Checkout the second source.
# text = I prefer darker colors because I can see their eggs ,more easily and the fish look better next to them.
# text = Use a well rinsed medicine vial, a cork, new fishing bobber or even a piece of non-crumbly styrofoam to float them.
# text = There are a couple ways one could spawn lineatus - mop spawning & water incubating them for two weeks, picking eggs from a mop & putting them in a tray of treated, seasoned water or setting up the parents in a planted tank & moving them so the fry can hatch out there.
# text = If you have the room to separate the male(s) & females(s),& feed them well on live foods, (assuming that you are doing weekly 50% water changes) when you put them together they will leave a lot more eggs.
# text = Just making up examples, but if a pair is constantly together, they may lay 10-15 eggs a day.
# text = With extra blackworms and maybe frozen (defrosted, rinsed) frozen foods earlier in the day, they may leave 30-40 eggs at a time.
# text = Separated and feed extremely nourishing stuff, they may produce more.
# text = Separating a pair some time before a show (killies are usually shown & judged & often sold as pairs) will encourage them to court and show their best colors.
# text = They also start the day with no nicks or dings in their fins.
# text = The water changes help with that too.
# text = You also may need to treat the incubation water.
# text = The chlorine and ammonia (choramine) are not good for the eggs.
# text = Ironically sometimes it is wise to leave the newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs.
# text = THEN put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to "breathe".
# text = Leaving a jar with a dozen black worms in it will sate the adult's desire for snacks and they are more likely to leave fry or eggs alone.
# text = If a pair isn't leaving eggs... check the following:
# text = 1. Is a tank mate (such as another female killie or a Cory or large snails) rating the eggs?
# text = 2. Have we kept up with partial water changes?
# text = 3. Is there too much mineral in the water?
# text = Aplo. lineatus are wide-spread over southern India.
# text = That indicates that they thrive in different water chemistries.
# text = Still if you can get your pet shop to do a hardness or TDS (total Dissolved Solids) test, that may give you a hint.
# text = Winging it a little here, a hardness of 100 to nearly 200 PPM (parts per million) or 5.8 to 10.6 DH should be fine for gardneri.
# text = TDS meters (the thrifty aquarist's hardness meter can be used if one has seen one of your municipal water department's annual reports.
# text = They include a number of minerals there and you can figure out what percentage of that would be your hardness minerals (calcium, magnesium and iron).
# text = A number of minerals are not of much consequence.
# text = However if there is a high level of sodium chloride (common salt) that can break down the chorion (shell) around the egg and allow critters to get in and eat the yoke and embryo.)
# text = Ironically sometimes it is wise to newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs.
# text = THEN put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to "breathe".
# text = If you get eggs in the mail in a medicine vial, that is fine.
# text = But get the eggs out, maybe rinsed in fresh tap water and then into the incubation water.
# text = In time the eggs can suffocate in the shipping container.
# text = After a number of people began complaining about "mystery deaths"among incubating eggs, some of the more advanced killie people began suggesting that after 7-8 days of incubation, one should do a 100% water change - as the eggs develop, they do release waste material.
# text = Another problem is that sometimes bad eggs will fungus and the fungus will spread out and kill all the eggs.
# text = Some people put in a very dilute Acriflaven solution to slow down the fungus, so one can take white eggs out with a pipette or eyedropper.
# text = Other will add a drop of Methylene blue.
# text = If an egg turns blue, it had died and then became dyed as the outer membrane broke down.
# text = Get those out ASAP too.
# text = Hope there is useful grist for the mill here.
# text = Disney cruise line with young ones?
# text = I will be taking my 3 and 4 yr olds.
# text = What is the best time of year?
# text = Should I get a balcony?
# text = Any tips or advice to make this a great experience??
# text = Thanks!!!
# text = It is vacation time.
# text = Many families are set to plan a best holidaying.
# text = They look for fun filled, rejuvenating and memorable vacation.
# text = There can be many ideas; one can see numerous options passing through their mind.
# text = What is the best option?
# text = Especially if you are planning to spend couple days with family and kids, which best suit you can select?
# text = Disney cruises, is a simple answer to this.
# text = There are many reasons to say Disney cruise is the best bet for you to have a enjoyable holiday tour.
# text = From 1998 onwards, from its inception Disney cruise has attracted many and continue to attract more and more.
# text = This is a spectacular ship, a very popular choice of families to spend their leisure time.
# text = The ship is designed thematically, with imposing animated cartoon characters.
# text = Do you feel that the holidaying with the animated cartoons will impress only young ones?
# text = No, the luxurious facilities and fun filled activities in the Disney cruise are very attractive to people of all ages.
# text = Whatever be the age, you will have the choice of variety of activities to forget about your hectic day-to-day activities.
# text = Kids fun games and video shows are added to the other facilities.
# text = There are two ships, Disney magic and Disney wonder.
# text = Both are made keeping in mind the comforts of the travelers.
# text = Disney cruises offer 24-hour room services, and the crews are ready to serve you the way you like.
# text = It has got very spacious rooms, furnished completely and neatly.
# text = These are decorated uniquely and marvelously.
# text = The ship offers variety of eatables, deliciously made.
# text = Sea fishes, prawns and many nice options are there in different restaurants aboard.
# text = There are many good options of delicious food on the shores as well.
# text = There are special regions uniquely and imposingly designed for the children.
# text = They can spend many hours enjoying the Disney world magic.
# text = These theme parks have all types of facilities.
# text = Video shows, cartoon stories, wonderful games and many such facilities.
# text = It is really an entertainment for the kids.
# text = The amusing world of cartoons and stories will be a memorable experience for the children.
# text = There are other amnesties also.
# text = These include space for dances and music, bar facility, gambling facilities for the elder, spaciously made open area aboard and many such nice facilities.
# text = Also one can keep their privacy in the cabins and make the time in seclusion.
# text = To relax and to rejuvenate Disney cruise are the best option.
# text = There are many online sites offering the booking facility with affordable rates.
# text = You can select the proper route and travel plans by consulting the agents prior to the booking........
# text = Off season is good, however, the Disney cruises are almost ALWAYS completely booked.
# text = I would suggest a warmer season, but not Spring Break or early summer.
# text = You may also want to avoid Thanksgiving week and the Christmas holidays.
# text = We REALLY enjoyed our balcony-- coffee in the mornings, drinks at night, standing outside when docking and leaving port-- however, it is quite a bit more expensive.
# text = With young ones, I would definitely get a window or view room so they can see outside.
# text = Check out the kids' space as soon as you get onboard.
# text = Do NOT feel guilty about taking them there.
# text = They have a BLAST so the sooner they get there, the sooner they can have fun.
# text = We liked getting the late dinner seating, so you have more time to see movies and stuff but if your kids are 'early to bed' you may want the earlier seating for dinners.
# text = Bring some sort of magnet or small magnetic whiteboard for your door.
# text = All of the doors tend to look alike and having 'something' on your door helps you and your kids find your room easier.
# text = You can also leave notes for the rest of your family (husband) about where you are at any given point.
# text = Cell phones do NOT work on board but they give you a 'walkie-talkie' kind of phone in your room that WILL work onboard.
# text = Each evening you will get a 'magazine' called The Navigator which lists all of the activities for the next day.
# text = We always took ours to dinner and discussed what things we felt we 'had' to do and which ones we felt like skipping in lieu of just chilling.
# text = Any time would be great.
# text = off season cruises might actually be better with preschoolers as prices might be lower in the off season.
# text = My wife and I, in our 60's at the time, originally planned a 3 generation trip but some family emergencies caused everyone else to cancel.
# text = We had a ball.
# text = We had an inside cabin and it is what I would recommend.
# text = There are so many things to do that you will only use your room for sleeping and the extra cost of the balcony is wasted.
# text = The children can be checked in and checked out in a safe way at many activities so you can have a bit of free time without the little ones.
# text = The range of activities can be illustrated by describing the water activities.
# text = There is a splash fountain (no standing water) for little ones still in diapers; Next is a wading pool for those who are potty trained; Then a family pool; Finally there is a pool for adults only with kids not allowed.
# text = You will never be so spoiled in your life as you are on a Disney Cruise.
# text = If you stay with your dining schedule, every night is dinner and a show.
# text = The real payoff is that you will have the same waiter for the entire cruise.
# text = Our waiter quickly grasped the fact that I like Ginger ale and rather spicy foods while my wife's taste ran to lemonade and less spicy fare.
# text = Since they knew our preferences, we almost always went along with their menu suggestions and were never sorry we did.
# text = Obviously they had a full beverage list including alcohol for adults who wanted it.
# text = If you should miss a meal, you also missed a great show.
# text = but food is always available and it is consistently good.
# text = I think I gained three pounds in my week long cruise.
# text = This is about my farrier, girls.
# text = That's why I'm posting here!
# text = Help?
# text = I posted this in singles and dating too, so I've just copied and pasted.
# text = Well, I'll try to make this short.
# text = I have known this guy for a long time, but we've never been good friends or anything.
# text = He is my farrier (shoes my horses feet) so I am technically a client if you want to view it that way.
# text = Well, almost two weeks ago he came out and did my horses feet and was SO flirty.
# text = He always hugs me when he comes, but he gave me at least 5 tight, long, back rubbing hugs while he was there.
# text = We were also just talking about my horse's crappy feet and he mentioned.
# text = "Well, if you ever just want to see me I'll come out and look him over and then we can grab a coffee after."
# text = That has NEVER happened before so I was kinda realizing at that point that he was a little interested.
# text = Right??
# text = Anyway, so he ended up leaving one nail out of my horses foot(I've never heard of a farrier doing this) and telling me to call him in a few days(first it was a week, then it was a few days lol) and he'd come back out and put it in.
# text = He told me to remember to call like 3 times before he left.
# text = So, I waited a week to call because I was busy and I wanted to have him come out on a day when I am more available in case we were to hang out after ;)
# text = Anyway, so that was 2 days ago that I called and left a message, but he still hasn't called back yet.
# text = I don't know if I should call him again tomorrow or not?
# text = I know a lot of people say to wait until he calls you, but it's different because I'm a client and technically that's all I am at this point.
# text = On the other hand though, if I'm a client he should really of called back by now because you don't leave a customer hanging.
# text = He didn't have my number either because this was the first time I've called HIM instead of his dad.
# text = It's a father and son business.
# text = Anyway, I would appreciate ANY insight on this at all.
# text = Thank you for reading if you did! :)
# text = Ok, well as far as him being a bad farrier for leaving a nail out - That is not the case, they are extremely well known farriers in the area.
# text = I would be a lot more concerned if the shoe fell off because it was missing one lousy nail.
# text = The reason he said he didn't put that nail in was because he "didn't want to risk it" with my horse's horrible feet.
# text = This is about the fourth time they've done my horse's feet because I just switched back to them.
# text = The only reason I switched away from them in the first place is because my good friend who apprenticed with them was starting out on his own.
# text = However, he left my horse without a shoe for TWO WEEKS(now that's what I call a crap farrier).
# text = Which, I might add is the same foot that keeps crumbling with the nails.
# text = So, obviously I switched back to these guys.
# text = Ok, calm down, it's not like he's some stranger that came up and groped me lol.
# text = I've known the guy for about 10 years.
# text = I am 21, so yeah we were both kids when we knew each other!
# text = He is a few years older than me.
# text = And yes, I do like him.
# text = To answer Barry White, yes that did occur to me :) I hope that is all he's waiting for.
# text = On the other hand, he could very easily just call me and say hey I'm busy right now, I'll call you when I can come out.
# text = And as far as scheduled visits go, I have no idea.
# text = I've never done that before though either.
# text = It's always just "Okay, they're feet need to be done, better call the farrier."
# text = And they usually come out within a few days.
# text = He will call you back Im sure!
# text = Sounds like He really likes you..
# text = But you need to ask yourself do you feel the same way?
# text = would You like going for *coffee* with him?
# text = or is he Not your type?
# text = Or are you undecided?
# text = If i were you I would Go...
# text = I would say if he does not call you back by friday call him again he could be playing hard to get?
# text = I think he left the Nail out of the shoe as a excuse to come back and see you hey he may be your Prince charming..
# text = Edit... I really dont think Your horse Is in danger Of being hurt With one Nail missing..
# text = I have seen horses Loose Nails On there Own And do just fine with ONE nail gone Now if he had left out 2 or 3 I would be wondering to...
# text = I really do belive he left the nail out becuse of the horses Hoof condition and Its a added bonus he would get to see her again
# text = When I was Younger In my early 20s My farrier was A hottie named Joby..( for those who don't Know I AM A GIRL read my Bio on my Page) dumb as a post about everything But horses..
# text = He was In his 30s divorced and Had 2 kids.. but we both flirted Horribly with each other.. but neither one of us took the chance and Asked to other on a date. :(
# text = sorta wonder what it would have been like?
# text = But That was Years ago.
# text = He had this Habit of telling you Everything..
# text = Well one day he said to me You know i don't wear Underwear as he was bent over Working on my Mares Right front hoof.. and I was Like Ummmm okay???
# text = Im glad his butt was facing me so he couldn't see my red face I think my Mare was even laughing..
# text = Well 6 weeks Later when he came back out He was again working on my mares front Foot and I looked Down and Yeah he had Wholes In his pants In the wrong places I bust out Laughing and He was like what???
# text = I was like Ummmm i can see your ass cheeks...he was like Oops did i forget my Underwear???
# text = that was a strange way to flirt.. but i guss it was his way...
# text = But like i said nothing ever came of It.. the next time I saw him He had told Me he had To get married to a girl Who he worked with becuse he knocked Her Up..
# text = I was heartbroken.. but then realized He was not the Guy for me..
# text = Wow he does sound interested in you, my farrier never gives me hugs like that (probably a good thing as he has a wife and 2 kids) anyway, I find that they can be very busy so I would wait a week lo9nger and if still no reply give him a call but don’t leave a message so you don’t have to necessarily wait for him to call.
# text = From the point of view of a business, and client/operator relationships, he's doing a really shitty job.
# text = Leaving nails out so you'll call and have him come back out later?
# text = Cute or not, I'd call a different bloke because he's doing a sub-par job at something he needs to be doing his best at, whether he's flirting or trying to ask you out or not, he ought to put quality first.
# text = This is, after all, his business, and if he wants you to remain a customer why on earth is he doing shoddy work?
# text = EPM, Anyone Dealt with it?
# text = Might be something different?
# text = I have the opportunity to pick up a super nice 6 year old for free.
# text = He's not lame, but he's been having issues.
# text = Here's what the owner has said:
# text = I have a 5 year old that lost all of his cheek muscle on the right side about 3-4 months ago.
# text = I chalked it up to possible nerve damage, because this is what the vet thought and the other cheek muscle was fine and he had no theeth problems.
# text = So I sent him to the trainers the first of September to be started on the barrels.
# text = I got him back the first of the month and he had lost some weight but attributed that to be worked everyday (I expected him to drop some).
# text = He is now losing the cheek muscle on the left side of his face and seems to be dropping weight by the day.
# text = Had him to a dentist yesterday and there is no teeth problems.
# text = He can eat all his feed and doesn't drop any, but cannot eat hay from lack of muscle to chew it.
# text = He is gant looking in his flank area and is losing topline muscle.
# text = The only neurological sign that he shows is that he barely drags his toes and sometimes has trouble with his right lead.
# text = The horse I had posted about a couple weeks ago with the atrophied cheek muscles is down to his last resort for life.
# text = I CANNOT afford to treat whatever is wrong with him.
# text = NO, I have not done an EPM test but have done an extensive blood panel and my vet did a neurological physical exam.
# text = We elected to not do the EPM test because there was NO neurological signs.
# text = He is still showing no signs other than the weight loss, and some muscle atrophy.
# text = He eats all of his grain but it just takes him a while to get it chewed because of the lack of muscle in his jaws.
# text = So I might get the horse and see what I can do.
# text = I will be getting with my vet first and if I do get him, have the spinal fluid test done for EPM and a titer test.
# text = Will be getting a copy of the blood results the owner has already ran as well.
# text = My other theory would be wobblers.
# text = I'll be having my equine chiro/acupuncturist out to do some work as well if I do get him....
# text = So any ideas?
# text = Think I should do it?
# text = Arby,
# text = Horse is out of state and not local.
# text = I will be calling my vet and chiro about him.
# text = He's still rideable currently and not having many issues under saddle.
# text = This is a horse that I otherwise wouldn't be able to afford and even if I spend 2K and treatment I come out ahead of his purchase price.
# text = I posted what the owner as said in paragraph 2 & 3, that is not me to clarify.
# text = She is the one that can't afford to do anything else for him in case he doesn't recover fully.
# text = He can eat grain and I already have a feed regimen in my head for the guy since he can't eat regular hay.
# text = I don't think it will be hard to keep his weight up so long as he can eat the grain.
# text = I am not going to go pick up a horse I can't afford.
# text = I am willing to pull the EPM test and treat.
# text = The owner is the one who is unable.
# text = I will also be having my other vet up who's a chiro & acupuncturist to evaluate him for wobblers.
# text = July is when he started to exhibit slight symptoms and the owner and vet originally thought it was just some nerve damage from something in the pasture with no visible injury.
# text = He's only exhibited weight loss and some muscle atrophy, with the slight toe drag and a bit of trouble with the right lead (which could or couldn't be related).
# text = The horse is not in pain.
# text = He's not starving.
# text = He's dropping we
# text = The horse is not in pain.
# text = He's not starving.
# text = He's dropping weight, but most of that came from being at the trainers and being ridden hard for 60 days.
# text = He's not putting it back on.
# text = I know that I have the possibility of treating him and still having to put him down.
# text = At the same time I do know people who have had horses come back successfully after EPM.
# text = I know this is going to be expensive.
# text = I'm willing to give it a shot.
# text = Gallop, I've already read that whole site and been reading through research articles from the research colleges as well.
# text = Looked at studies, treatment options and such.
# text = I will have the EPM test done before treating.
# text = The chiro/acupuncturist will be there to evaluate the horse for wobblers which is often caused by spinal compression and can be confused with EPM.
# text = If that is the case then acupuncture isn't going to hurt him.
# text = It's actually one of the alternative therapies for EPM
# text = I think it is wonderfully responsible that you are going into this rescue eyes open and are getting the opinions of qualified professionals (and a bunch of Yahoos) before you decide to take this horse on.
# text = I do think some Y!A users need to work on their reading comprehension as I can't comprehend how taking a horse in as a rescue and getting it qualified medical treatment is abuse.
# text = Worst case scenario you fall in love and after spending thousands of dollars you have to put the horse down.
# text = Is that something you are up for?
# text = If so go for it and I'll give you all the moral support I can as you figure out what is up.
# text = It is heartbreaking to try to bring a horse back and then have to put it down, but some horses are worth the risk.
# text = If you feel this guy is worth it then I hope your vet can figure things out.
# text = As to EPM like Shee said being in MI we've had to deal with it.
# text = Pretty much every large stable has here.
# text = Our first diagnosed EPM horse was back when there was no treatment in the US and only an experimental chicken feed additive in Canada.
# text = We hauled the horse to Windsor and got him treated there.
# text = That horse returned to racing and we didn't notice much difference.
# text = We've had a few since then, but none since our race horses began wintering in Florida.
# text = I have no idea if that is related or farmers are doing a better job of clearing out opossums now because they know opossums are carriers, but we haven't had an EPM horse in at least 10 years.
# text = I can say all of our EPM horses were treated early when they were showing mild signs like Shee gave and all returned to racing.
# text = One horse even got his lifetime mark after being treated for EPM.
# text = We've always liked big long trotters that do better on mile tracks then 1/2 mile.

# text = Eulogic
# text = Good place to be on a Sunday Night.
# text = The beers were good, nice choice of beers as well, and as usual the mussels were great, the place upstairs is a nice addition to the bar downstairs.

# text = I'm hoping the bakers continue to do their baking out of another place, because it would be a shame not to have these cakes any longer.
# text = Super nice people, really good food
# text = What I love most about this place, other than the food, is that eating here makes you feel like you're in a small town rather than Baltimore.
# text = The owners are really nice, they serve good food at a good price, and the option to eat outside on the deck (esp on the weekend whether there is hardly any traffic) is great.
# text = One of my top 5 places to eat in Baltimore.
# text = Overpriced
# text = This place is identical to the Youngstown Sports Grille, so I imagine they are owned/operated by the same people.
# text = The food is mediocre at best, and largely overpriced given the portion size and quality.
# text = Don't even get me started on how expensive it is to drink there.
# text = I have ate here 3 times since they first opened, and the service has been poor each time, the staff always comes across as somewhat rude and slow.

# text = If you're a fan of herpes, being ripped off, and child molesters, this is the garage for you.
# text = If not, go somewhere else.
# text = Rude service
# text = even though I have never tried hoa salon but I agree with other reviewers that they are rude.
# text = I called and asked about the price for hair updo and the receptionist or owner who aswered the phone refused to tell me, or even just give me an approximate price range.
# text = He told us to stop by the salon and then he will tell us the price.
# text = What kind of rude service is that?
# text = I don't want to waste my time with them.
# text = Top notch eats!
# text = So here we are in Manson.

# text = Boutique stores dealing in children's clothing/gifts are often outrageously priced (who wants to pay 40 dollars for a newborn onesie?)
# text = but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Purple Goose's prices are reasonable (for the SAME products found at other area boutiques, the prices were 20-25% cheaper).
# text = The service was also excellent - friendly, helpful and informative without being overbearing.
# text = Will definitely return.
# text = Consistantly poor
# text = A lack of organisation, coupled with the distain for its customers, makes this the worst rental agency I have used.
# text = Chasing them on issues from the day I moved in (many of them still unresolved as I left) to all sorts of farcical issues with funds, after I left. . . . as soon as I could.
# text = If you must use them, be vigilant and be ready to push, if you can go elsewhere then I would.
# text = AMAZING NIGHT- Great Party Spot!!
# text = Went to the Willow Lounge this past weekend for dinner and drinks...place is awesome.
# text = Had to keep in mind that the A/C broke, I feel bad it was their opening!

# text = The Bad: I was at Napa recently and was unpleasantly surprised at poor waiter svce and subpar food.

# text = Napa is all about wine but gives very short descriptions of the wines on their lists.
# text = I found my initial selection satisfactory but the wine flight we chose to be poorly composed.
# text = If you must go ask lots of questions about your selections since your expectations may as high as mine were.
# text = Highly Recommended
# text = We walked in to pick our little man at 10 minutes to closing and heard laughter from kids and the staff.
# text = The facilities are more than adequate and the staff are just phenomenal.
# text = Their sense of humour and calmness when dealing with the little ones amazes me every time I walk in.
# text = We have since moved slightly further away from the centre but it's worth the extra travel, as the care provided exceeds our expectations... especially after a few horrendous daycare experiences elsewhere.
# text = HORRIBLE!!!!!

# text = Great Barber
# text = Firstly, the other reviewer clearly has never been to Nick's, or he would know that Nick only charges $13 for a haircut which is pretty much industry standard.
# text = I have been going to Nick for 5 months now precisely because he does pay attention to detail.
# text = I have terrible hair and he really takes his time to make it look right.
# text = Some of the younger kids that work there are a bit sub par, but if you wait for Nick... you'll be good.
# text = UGH!!!

# text = Dave has much to offer.
# text = In just 2-3 focused lessons, I'm already now capable of picking up new songs off YouTube guitar how to videos and am even writing my own orginals with confidence!

# text = Another Italian restaurant in Collingswood?

# text = I am not saying it is a 5 star hotel.
# text = I am saying when comparing all other hotels in Wildwood, this hotel has everything that we are looking for.
# text = It is the hospitality from Tom and staff, that makes it feel like a 5 star hotel in the middle of the beach.

# text = I have been a patient a NW hospital and it was great.
# text = I have also had an 80 yr old that I take of sent to the ER and long stays in the hospital.
# text = Yes, we had to wait, but ER is a triage system that takes the most life threatening cases first.
# text = Any ER would be the same.

# text = As a nurse I know about drug seekers.
# text = This is a great hospital and even better since it became part of the UW system.
# text = Wonderful Experience

# text = HORRIBLE
# text = This school is the worst one i've ever been to.
# text = I attended it for 2 years, and that was enough.
# text = There's holes everywhere in the ceiling, sewage constantly leaks through the ceiling, and the whole condition of the school is horrible.
# text = The staff and the Principal are rediculous, they don't listen to any input, and they make up rediculous rules ( They banned backpacks, because a teacher TRIPPED OVER a student's).
# text = The education is horrible at best, do society a favor, and do NOT send your student here.
# text = Excellent customer service and quality work.
# text = They went the extra mile to repair my cowboy boots-- they had to have a special kind of paper that looked like wood grain to fix the heels.
# text = That was 4 years ago.
# text = I haven't been able to find a shoe repair place in Seattle since that has been able to do it.
# text = (I've been through at least 5 places already.)
# text = If I had time to drive to Tacoma before they closed during the work week, I would just so I could get those boots fixed properly again.
# text = So Handy for Local La Jolla Stuff - Especially for Finding Residential Numbers
# text = Since moving back from college and trying to settle roots in the Village, I have referred to the La Jolla Blue Book for a ton of local numbers.
# text = The white pages allowed me to get in touch with parents of my high school friends so that I could track people down one by one and the restaurant section is basically my cookbook.
# text = It's really cool that so many local businesses are found so quickly in one place and I want to spread the word.
# text = THX:-)
# text = The staff do occasionally get game info correct, but if your looking fot a good game and aren'ta nerd, dont ask them.
# text = The last time I did that I was suggested to buy oblivion when I told them I was looking for a fps.
# text = I knew what it was and told the guy that it wasn'ta fps.
# text = Overall they aren't very knowledge about the type of games are on the market.
# text = First and Last time we'll eat there
# text = My friend and I went there for lunch today.
# text = Neither one of us had ever been - so we thought we'd try it.
# text = BIG MISTAKE - The food was tasteless and cold.
# text = We both kept trying to find something we liked.
# text = The only thing I found edible were the potato wedges, I finally gave up, he kept trying - he found the fried wantons to be OK - His Mongolian bowl was awful.
# text = Would NOT recommend this place to anyone - in fact - save your money and go somewhere else.
# text = Liquidweb.com Rocks!!!
# text = I am not a client of liquidweb.com, but one of my friend called Steven is the client having several websites.
# text = I work with him and since past 6 years he is hosting his websites to Liquidweb.
# text = As I have gone through many reviews sites to see if any provider is providing better services or not, and I have realized that there were many good reviews about Liquidweb also Steven never faced any server issues in his whole hosting.

# text = I've been to this shop twice (once for an inspection and again for an oil change) and they truly live up to their name: Discount!

# text = The thing is, you still get high quality service at nicely discounted rates!
# text = There is even free coffee and bottles of water if you'd like.
# text = The owner is a pleasant guy and I would trust my car with him or any of his workers.
# text = Top notch, all the way!

# text = I would highly recommend David to anyone.
# text = He will exceed your expectations!
# text = He doesn't just take pictures he makes art out of them and you won't even notice that there's a camera there.
# text = Not so great
# text = My husband just got a bike there as a gift he's only had it a month.
# text = It's a nice bike and it cost a lot of money.
# text = But just this week a peddle broke.
# text = He took it back and they would not honor a warranty and said it was his fault because of his shoes??
# text = So they were going to charge him for new peddles and proceeded to put them on without even telling him the price.
# text = Which was very expensive.
# text = He asked for a different pair instead and they only gave him five dollars off??
# text = Trek is not so great
# text = Only Concerned With Money
# text = I have been getting my treatments for a few months now and have seen some results but not up to the standards that I was told I should expect.
# text = The people there attempt to come across and professional and nice, but I was disappointed with their customer service.
# text = Never miss an appointment because they will charge you the price of a treatment, even if you had an emergency.
# text = It's pretty ridiculous!
# text = They want to squeeze as much as they can from you even if you just got in a car accident!!!!
# text = They don't care one bit about you!!!!!
# text = Terrible service!!!
# text = Made an appointment to have them come to the house to discuss curtain options and give an estimate.
# text = They sent over someone who said he knows nothing about curtains and could not show me fabric options or give an estimate.
# text = When I called the manager to complain, she said she KNEW the guy didn't know about curtains and that the usual lady called in sick hours earlier!
# text = Instead of rescheduling they chose to waste my time instead.
# text = So what was the point of the appointment!?!
# text = To just come over and hang out?!?
# text = I will NEVER do business with this company!
# text = EVER!!!
# text = Internet Department is rude and insulting
# text = I was looking to bring a customer to their lot to buy a car but the Internet salesperson Last name is Balazick sent me this email "AND IF IT WAS WORTH MY TIME I WOULD OF BOTHERED ASWERING YOUR QUESTIONS.
# text = I MAKE MONEY NOT DEAL WITH BROKERS" Wow, can you believe in todays tough times this dealership would be looking for any way to move vehicles.
# text = As a previous Internet Manager I would deal with anyone looking to buy a car for a profit and not care if they came in with a broker.
# text = Stay away from this dealership!!!
# text = This place is a Rip-Off
# text = I brought a car in to have the "check engine" light diagnosed back in March of 2010.
# text = They said it was "plugs and wires" and quoted me $330 to do the work, including parts.
# text = I asked why so high and they said it was due to the labor of moving things out of the way.
# text = Those things ended up being a windsheild washer fluid tank (1 screw) and the air filter canister (4 spring clips).
# text = I did the work myself for $50.
# text = There's no excuse for that kind of estimate.
# text = My girlfriend and I took a chance on this place because we didn't want to wait in line at Outback.
# text = What an amazing find - this restaurant is a GEM.
# text = #1 its immaculately clean.

# text = Thank you for helping me get more healthy!
# text = I came in and saw Dr. Ruona about a month ago for quitting smoking.

# text = Signs of Saltford - an excellent supplier of value for money signs and banners etc.

# text = Fantastic for kids
# text = If you have children or are just a real animal lover yourself you'll love this zoo.
# text = It's only $10 and in essence just one big petting zoo.
# text = They sell feed and milk bottles at the front and I recommend you buy lots.
# text = We took our 7 month old and she laughed and giggled when (very harshly I might add) grabbing and 'kissed' the goats and lambs.
# text = The animals were all very sweet and patient with her.

# text = Wonderful, inexpensive and lots of fun!
# text = WOW!!!
# text = I can't say enough good things about Karla and the wonderful things she has done for me and my dog Gracee.
# text = She has always been there for Gracee even for last minute calls!
# text = She has taken care of my sweet girl for almost 4 years now and I would not let Gracee go with anyone besides her!!!
# text = She is caring, punctual, and very enthusiastic about her job!
# text = You should give her a try - it's worth every penny to know that you pet is in GREAT hands with Wunderbar pet sitting!!!!
# text = Worst Service I've Ever Experienced
# text = I wish there was something good to say about the business, but unfortunately, there isn't.
# text = 1) Service and manners were nonexistent.
# text = 2) The employees constantly talk down to customers and are very argumentative for the sake of being argumentative.
# text = (to both myself and customers) 3) I have never experienced so much rudeness coming from a business.
# text = 4) The business is very unorganized.
# text = The invoice is not detailed, so it is difficult to see what you are paying for.
# text = I'd recommend to save your time and energy and find another greek store.
# text = Exile is the best!!!
# text = Exile is the longest lasting and most authentic punk store in Richmond!
# text = I have been shopping there for over six years now.
# text = The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful and the owner, Mimmy, is an absolute angel.
# text = The mark up is minimal considering that the clothing is hard to find and often shipped for Europe.
# text = In addition, the clothing is of much better quality than the clothing from hot topic, which is made as cheaply as possible by people living in horrible conditions in Asia.
# text = Exile is environmentally conscious and involved heavily in our community.
# text = Shop local at Exile!!
# text = Over-rated
# text = Buddakan inevitably attracts the majority of its guests simply because of its association with Steven Starr, but that doesn't impress me.
# text = The atmosphere alone deserves 4 stars but, the food was not up to par with the price tag and the reputation the restaurant carries.
# text = The server we had was knowledgeable but he was not as proper as he should have been, acting like he was talking to his friends rather than his customers.
# text = The angry lobster was completely over-priced!
# text = $80 for a dish that has about one small lobster tail and is full of filler vegetables!
# text = I wouldn't go there again.
# text = Alto delivers on all levels.
# text = From the moment you enter the restaurant, you know you are some place special.
# text = The service is impeccable, and the food is even better.
# text = I highly recommend the four-course tasting menu, which gives you plenty of range and food to satisfy your appetite.
# text = Also, if you are into wine, Alto has the depth of both region, varietal, and vintage to satisfy nearly any sommelier (or after 9pm, bring your own bottle for free...no corking fee!).
# text = While it's not cheap, Alto will give you an experience you'll never forget.
# text = The landlord is not nice nor helpful
# text = I have lived in Buckingham Condominiums townhouse for 2 years.
# text = I love the location and the apartment!!
# text = I'ma single female and I feel safe coming home at night.
# text = The maintenance people are AWESOME!!!!
# text = And the exterminator is very nice, also.
# text = Yes, you still have a few bugs, but that's going to be anywhere you go!
# text = The only problem that I have experienced is the landlord.
# text = She is a pure b****!!!
# text = I know that's ugly...but she won't help you out for anything...sad story.
# text = Other than that, I would recommend living here. :)
# text = The staff leaves a lot to be desired.
# text = The front staff has seen quite a bit of turnover and changed from professional to rude.
# text = A simple follow-up phone call with a woman quickly turned into a nightmare.
# text = She may be the reason for all the change.
# text = I sincerely wonder if the doctor has a clue about what is going on within his practice.
# text = If he does know and approves of this behavior then it is a poor reflection on him.
# text = Sometimes it is not worth it to go through that kind of staff and their personal attitude to get to a doctor.
# text = He was an okay doctor but not worth her.
# text = WWW-Wonderful Wild Wildernest inn
# text = I would give the Wildernest inn ten stars of five!

# text = Kathy and Stewart, the proprietors were the epitome of perfection.
# text = Delightful, hospitable, superb,cozy and comfortable.
# text = I hope to be back!
# text = junkie lube?!
# text = really weird place, I was driving home from work thought I'd stop in for an oil change and well, there are a few guys in jiffy lube uniforms sitting at the table drinking beers and shooting the breeze.
# text = The neon lighting sign still said "on" yet some guy who seemed to be the oldest of the bunch, more like the drunkest of the bunch told me they'd be open tomorrow.
# text = I asked if a manager was on duty he told me he was.
# text = WOW!
# text = grey shirt "mark" of course with this type behavior he could have been wearing someonelses clothing.....
# text = A friend and I recently took our 16 and 18 month olds here.
# text = While there wasn't too much available for their age (ball pit, bouncy area and a little padded pyramid to climb on), we went right when they opened at 10 am on a winter weekday and ended up being the only ones there, so we were given a little more liberty than we would have if others had been there.
# text = It's not the classiest place, but it was cleaner than I expected and the staff was very friendly.
# text = For $4 it was a nice break from the monotony of winter indoors with a toddler.
# text = Restored my faith in Mechaincs.
# text = I spent 3 months going from shop to shop trying to get my Ferrari to run and drive the way it should.
# text = I was about to give up when I met Jason and Neal.
# text = They took on the challenge of making my Ferrari all I dreamed of and more.
# text = The crew at The Creative Workshop went over and above the call of duty and gave me back a car I can drive anywhere and finally enjoy owning.
# text = I cannot say enough about this place.
# text = They have restored my faith in Mechanics.
# text = Do yourself a favor, call these guys first and enjoy driving your car again..
# text = a great vacation!
# text = We wanted to see the sun - and we also got much more!
# text = Excellent chefs are in the kitchen preparing memorable breakfasts.
# text = After a train ride over the mountains, we enjoyed hiking in the flower-filled Wenatchee hills (in May) and a very interesting bike ride in a loop around the Columbia River...and then wine if we wanted it on the patio in the evening....
# text = This is a busy group of hosts they are also running a restaurant, which also must be wonderful - so just ask for what you need, and I'm sure they will do their best to be hospitable.
# text = OMG
# text = OMG.. make sure to book a reservation, as this magical place is packed (in a nice way) I love that the owner walks around and cares how his customers feel about their food.
# text = The waiters are like no other...
# text = My waiter was so excellent I gave him a 75% tip, and it was worht every penny..
# text = The food was finger licking the bowel fantastic..
# text = I just discovered her has a place right near my work ( Color me Phat) If you are looking for a romatic place with the best food and service in the valley Giovanni Ristorante should be your number 1 + 2 choice.
# text = Holly is truely the best hairstylist!
# text = I have lived in the UTC La Jolla area for many years, and I never new this salon was here until a friend reffered me to see Holly here.
# text = I was very pleased with my experience here.
# text = All of the people were friendly and welcoming.
# text = I got highlights, haircut, and a blowdry.
# text = She did a great job!
# text = Holly is very experienced and talented, and I could tell she new what she was doing right off the bat.
# text = My hair looks amazing, and I get compliments all the time.
# text = I deffenitly reccomend this salon and Holly to anyone.
# text = You will not be disappointed!!!!!!
# text = Outdated but not bad
# text = So I really felt like this place was extremely outdated especially since the pictures make it look nice and modern.
# text = It had listed that there was a hot breakfast but all this meant is that they added a waffle maker to the common continental affair at most cheap hotels.
# text = The family suite was basically two rooms with a small opening between them which worked great for us because we were two families traveling together.
# text = If you are in town and need that kind of space I say stay here but if you are looking for a little more upscale affair don't let the pictures fool you and book somewhere else.
# text = Great, and probably the only West Indian spot worth hitting up in Nashville.
# text = I was born and raised in Toronto, which has a huge West Indian (Trinidadian, Jamaican, etc) population.
# text = So huge in fact, that Toronto slang is influenced by and has Jamaican references, and Jamaican beef patties are staples in my high school cafeteria.
# text = Anyway, I was practically raised on this stuff, and being a connoisseur of West Indian cuisine, Jamaica Way is a bit toned down to suit the American palette.
# text = All you have to do to make it authentic Jamaican food, is add a whole lot of pepper.
# text = Alot.
# text = The finest Christmas Trees i've ever seen.
# text = I felt like I was in heaven when I walked through the majestic fields of this particular farm.
# text = The trees were in magnificent shape and the variety was astounding.
# text = The owners were entertaining and gracious.
# text = I especially liked the Eco friendly atmosphere and the owners love of all animals.
# text = This is one of the best farms I have ever been too.
# text = I would call it the Taj Mahal of the east coast!
# text = It put hair on my chest and thanks to the owners advice I invested vanguard, got myself a woman like Jerry, and became a republican.
# text = Thanks Tussey Mountain Tree Plantation!
# text = Pho-nomenal!!
# text = I have been eating Pho for almost my entire life and I've always gone to the Pho places in south philly and off the boulevard and even the other one in chinatown, but when i tried this pho place, it blew the other pho houses away!!
# text = all of the pho places taste the same to me, so what seperates one from the other is the service and the price.
# text = The service here is incredible compared to the other places.
# text = remember to bring cash since they don't take debit or credit.
# text = hope this helps!!
# text = Had a horrible experience with a manager here, Rachel McInnis, she was rude, inconsiderate and did not do the right thing for an item that was marked incorrectly...
# text = I'm not interested in shopping in a place with people like her... she refused to sell me the item at its marked price even after admitting they had made a mistake.
# text = I normally don't write reviews but seeing that I considered Dillards a distinguished, upscale place to shop, this one won't be getting my business, nor my family's, nor my co-workers.
# text = It's never ok to let a customer walk out unhappy, especially when they are right.
# text = Highly Recommend
# text = I work as a Transformational Life Coach.
# text = Since this is an alternative therapy I always refer clients to a lisenced therapist when I feel that is appropriate.
# text = I found her through a colleague one day when one of my clients was in the midst of a panic attack and needed professional help that I am not qualified to provide.
# text = Little did I know that I would soon be needing her help as well!
# text = She guided me through a very difficult period dealing with a family member's suicide, coupled with elder abuse.
# text = I found her to be extremely solid, kind, compassionate, and intuitive as well.
# text = I would recommend her highly!
# text = They won't have a second chance from me.
# text = First, let me state that although I live in NYC, I am not from NYC, I don't care about baseball and I absolutely love Boston to death (so beautiful, so clean, so awesome).
# text = That said, I hated this restaurant.
# text = The service was just about as good as I'd get in NYC (that means it was poor) and the food was almost mediocre.
# text = The decor left a lot to be desired and the posters telling me all the reasons 99 was great just served as an ironic contrast against the reality.
# text = Personally I recommend you take your money elsewhere
# text = When I arrived at Brickell Honda on 6/4/11, I was greeted and attended to by the Sales Manager, Gustavo Guerra, in a very friendly and professional manner.
# text = I explained to him what I wanted and that I previously went to Braman Honda.
# text = Bramen Honda was a bit of a hassle.
# text = He told me "no problem, we will match the offer or do better."
# text = Mr. Guerra gave me a better deal without any hassles nor any type of problems.
# text = Brickell Honda has been the best buying experience in the world.
# text = I urge all St. Thomas the Apostle parishioners and all of South Florida residents to come see Gus!!!
# text = Excellent customer service!!!
# text = Great, Honest Service
# text = I took my 2001 Nissan Frontier in to fix a cracked manifold.
# text = The dealer wanted $1300 to fix that and another $1500 to fix some other things.
# text = Eagle Transmission determined that much of the work the dealer said needed to be done was unneccesary and what needed to be fixed was only $400!!
# text = I was so impressed with the honesty and integrity of Mike and everyone at Eagle Transmission!
# text = I dropped the truck off in the morning and it was ready that afternoon.
# text = I have finally found a mechanic I trust!!
# text = And it was great that they did not charge a service fee to diagnose the problem - an added bonus!!
# text = Dr. Shady
# text = Kelly hit the nail on the head.
# text = "Dr. Shady" is a jerk.
# text = After the way she spoke to me on my last visit, I will not be returning!!
# text = Good luck keeping business with that stuck up attitude Dr. Shady.
# text = You have just lost mine.
# text = The next time you feel like being condescending to someone, it is not going to be me!!!!!!
# text = Dr. Shady is inexperienced and prideful.
# text = She probably does not even have 10% of the knowledge that some of the other EXPERIENCED vets do in this area.
# text = I will be carefully researching vets before I take my dog someplace else.
# text = Beautifully written reviews Doctor, but completely UNTRUE.
# text = Poor Experience
# text = I did not have a good experience w/ Dr. Ghassemlou.
# text = During the session, he demanded to have my physical address, which I've always kept private as I am enrolled in a witness protection program.
# text = I believe he is correct in that he needs my physical address for legal reasons, however, he did not adequately explain this during our session.
# text = I learned more about this doing my own research afterward.
# text = I think he could've done more to assuage my concerns by giving me concrete facts.
# text = Saying that I need to give him my address or else I have intimacy issues is not helpful.
# text = It's pretty combative actually.
# text = you'll love it
# text = I have had my back fused in 2 places.
# text = I wish that I hadn't done this.
# text = With these fusions, chiropractric isn't as successful, but it still is very helpful.
# text = Even after my fusions, my back continued to hurt, but now it doesn't hurt any more.
# text = I would encourage anyone who is thinking of back surgery, to talk about different treatment options first with Dr. de Barros.
# text = He really knows what he is talking about and will approach the different options fairly.
# text = You can see different treatments that a surgeon can't see, so that you can have several treatment options before you decide what to do.
# text = Unbelievably huge experience for such a small salon!!!
# text = I have been to Kim at Cheveux for more than five years.
# text = I cannot tell you how often I am complimented on my hair (style AND color)!
# text = I regularly request Kim's business cards as I am often stopped on the street and asked "Who does your hair...I LOVE it!!!"
# text = Quaint, lovely, small salon with BIG personality.
# text = I am made to feel special when I am in the chair and I have NEVER had a less than amazing cut or color experience.
# text = My hair has never felt this healthy, either.
# text = I cannot recommend this salon enough!!!
# text = Thanks Cheveux!
# text = My Favorite in McLean
# text = My family loves coming to Endo Sushi.They are very nice, it is never crowded, and the food is wonderful, very delicious and fresh!
# text = Sometimes it is hard to get parking in the lot in front of the storefront, and it is on a one-way street, but the restaurant itself is NEVER overcrowded.
# text = If you cannot park in the lot, then you can park in the shopping center's garage, and walk up to Endo Sushi.
# text = The service is fast.
# text = Be sure to ring the little bell on your way out if you enjoyed your meal!
# text = (it's by the door, on the hostess stand)
# text = Horrible Service!
# text = I got yelled at, literally yelled at because i asked if i could pick up my car 5-10 minutes late.
# text = I explained that i was already on my way and i would rush to get there as soon as i could because i needed my car for work at 5am, but the guy was arguing with me saying he was gonna lock the doors right at 5:30.
# text = Rude, unprofessional, just jerks.
# text = Seems like all they care about is the money and getting home on time, NO care for the customers AT ALL!!!
# text = Missed a whole day of work because i am now carless.
# text = I will NEEEEEEEEEVERRRR go to this place again.
# text = Superb Arrangements
# text = I used Fancy Flowers for my late husband's funeral flowers as they had been recommended to me.
# text = I am so glad that I called in to see Ana, she is a lovely girl who showed nothing but care and compassion towards me.
# text = The flowers were all that I hoped they would be, I have attended several funerals of late unfortunately and the flowers I recieved from Ana outshone them all.
# text = She is so talented, the flowers were arranged superbly and delicately, it is so obvious to see the difference between someone fully trained and skilled compared to others.
# text = Thank you Ana I hope to see you in the future under better circumstances.
# text = Great first experience.
# text = I'm 22, and my hairdresser was great (and not "old" like one of the reviews says) - she really listened to what I wanted and gave me tons of tips on how to style my hair so I could get it to look the way I wanted it to.
# text = She deep conditioned my hair and took the time to style it properly.
# text = She recommended products but absolutely didn't pressure me to buy.
# text = It's a cute place with a really friendly, laid-back atmosphere.
# text = I would highly recommend it and will be going back for my next haircut.
# text = Oh!
# text = And students get $5 off, can't argue with that.
# text = Smokers Haven
# text = Yeah, this complex is not very good.
# text = Our bathroom fan, one electric outlet and 2 leaky sinks have yet to be fixed.
# text = Both bathrooms look like they were flooded and the wood cabinets are thrashed at the bottom and they slapped some pieces of wood over to try to cover it up.
# text = And non-smokers beware!!!
# text = I think 90 percent of the tenants are smokers!
# text = If you do not smoke, do not move here.
# text = Our unit reeks of old cigarette smoke and it started to become apparent a few weeks after we moved in.
# text = You cannot walk 5 feet without smelling that disgusting cigarette smoke and it blows right into the windows all day and all night.
# text = Great Sanwiches, Great Prices
# text = I used to go here almost everyday since I work in the neighbourhood and loved their turkey and meatball sandwiches.
# text = Chicken salad salad is great too.
# text = Best of all, the staff is quick on their feet and even with long lines, usually serve you in 5 minutes or less.
# text = For the quality, the prices ($4-$6) have to be the best in town.
# text = The staff get to know regulars and do their job very well.
# text = Tourists like the other reviewer might not appreciate their efficiency or quality, but I certainly do.
# text = This isn'ta TGIF or Cafe, its a lunch sandwich place and a good one at that.
# text = Rate a church?
# text = Might as well just hotpot the curb and rate the traffic light.
# text = It's a bloody church, for chrisssake!
# text = Big, grey and imposing.
# text = Go there on christian holidays for a bit of churchy grandure.
# text = The pastor at this church is cool, I met him after some holiday service.
# text = He had a robe that was made back in the '60s.
# text = God was pleased with that one!
# text = It's historical for Sf, so when your aunte comes for a visit, take her there.
# text = Great for the kiddies - they love the labyrinth (don't forget to tell 'em its really a 'pagen' thing!).
# text = Stop by at least once or you'll go to heck!
# text = ok but just becuse we where on a tight budget.
# text = me and my dad where in NJ for a kc chiefs(my home team)vs the NY jets and for game 4 of the world series.
# text = i'ma red sox fan so i was glad that the phillies won.
# text = the knights inn was small very small.i mean 1 room in every room!it was cozy a little and a small tv.
# text = i mean a 2 day stay was a ok stay even tho the manager looked like he was chineze and that we only slept and went out from 8 to 7 to see New York.
# text = but sice we almost just slept there i cant give that good of a review
# text = It was a Saturday and my spring was broken...
# text = I googled Garage Door Repair in Woodinville and found NDI - Johnette answered the phone and was oh-so pleasant and helpful!
# text = She sort of appologized for Dan taking the day off to go skiing - but he could do the repair on Sunday!
# text = I said great and Dan arrived on time at 10am to make the repair.
# text = I enjoyed speaking with Dan, and learning more about how the springs are sized for these doors.
# text = The repair went quickly and the price was extremely fair.
# text = I would highly recommend NDI - and will spread the word to my neighbors.
# text = Thanks Dan and Johnette for your responsiveness and professional service.
# text = Roger M., Woodinville
# text = I wouldn't send my dogs there.
# text = I had a conversation with the woman running this place in April 2010.
# text = She basically said if the children getting off the bus aren't paying to enter her building she was going to let them wander around the streets.
# text = Wow, really?
# text = With all the child predators out there, a busy road, cars speeding by...... and you are going to let some 4/5 year olds wonder around cause you're money hungry?
# text = REAL CHRISTIAN OF YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# text = Whether they pay me or not, if their parents get into an accident, stuck in traffic, etc. THE LAST THING I WOULD DO IS LET A CHILD GET RAPED BECAUSE I WASN'T PAID.
# text = Excellent service
# text = I could easily go to Nordstrom for my designer jeans and pay the same price, but I go to the Garment District for their service.
# text = Previous reviewers said they were pushy and I can understand that, but I find the staff more helpful than anything else.
# text = Tiffany is fabulous!
# text = I came in for alterations (free, by the way) and told her about a stain I had on my new leather purse.
# text = She immediately went to the back, brought out leather cleaner and cleaned my purse on the spot.
# text = I didn't even buy the bag there!
# text = Huge selection and, great suggestions from the staff and they refer you to reliable places if they don't have what you need.
# text = We were expecting a great experience, when we recieved a friendly greeting by the hosts.
# text = The atmosphere was nice and very clean.
# text = The menu had plenty of options even for picky eaters.
# text = The service was ok, our waitress kept forgetting our drinks even though we reminded her several times.
# text = To start we tried the guacamole and salsa verde, it was completly flavorless.
# text = We should have left then.
# text = We orderd our meals anyway, chimichangas,jalapeno borritos, and quesadillas.
# text = Everything was bland, completely void of any spice or flavor.
# text = We have never had mexican food this bad, it was just simply gross.
# text = Hopefully they spice things up or they wont be in business long.
# text = I recommend La Hacienda
# text = Might try again
# text = Pros: * Jill, the owner, is very nice and really cares about her feedback * Pretty nice atmosphere * Great Dessert * Not your typical veggie selection, I like!
# text = Don't know where else you can find Purple Hull Peas and some of the other sides.
# text = Cons: * Server wasn't very pleasant * Pretty small portion on the blackened catfish * Overcooked food * Time, took about 25 minutes from ordering to eating.
# text = Half the tables and bar were empty by this point.
# text = Other Thoughts: Will try this place again.
# text = There must be a reason so many people like it there.
# text = Their Club sandwich looks tasty, maybe that'll change my mind.... and a different server.
# text = very professional / very helpful
# text = the people at Fidelity Leasing were very friendly and helpful.
# text = i was looking for a car but did not really know what i wanted and they were very helpful and took the time to first figure out what my needs were and showing me various options to meet those needs.
# text = they seemed more interested in helping me find the right car rather then just make a sale.
# text = my experience with them was great - low stress, very helpful and very personal.
# text = after finding the car i wanted they took the time to go over each step and making it as painless as possible.
# text = from start to finish they were top notch.
# text = i would highly recommend calling these people up for your next car.
# text = This insurance co. Is a joke !!!
# text = They have absolutely no communication skills whatsoever .
# text = if you don't mind being robbed ,cheated or lied to then this is the company for you .
# text = They will make every attempt to misinform and misrepresent themselves .
# text = They make up excuses in hopes to confuse their policy holders with misinformation .
# text = as an example they took payment for 5 out of 6 monthly plan premiums for a yearly policy and cancelled the contract for the remainder of the policy for reasons they stated was not receiving information on other licensed drivers in the household ?
# text = I personally provided the request on four separate occasions and they claim there is a glitch in their systems ?
# text = Ifa is an acronym for Im a F%#king Assh@%$e !!!
# text = Fantastic Service!
# text = I have been here a few times for oil changes and just got my tires, alignment and state inspection done yesterday.
# text = I shopped it around and they were extremely competitive in pricing and also added nitrogen to my tires which should extend the life and get me better gas mileage.
# text = It also came with free balance and rotation for the life of the tires!
# text = What made it perfect was that they offered transportation so that I would not have to wait there or take time off of work to go back and forth or try to find a ride.
# text = Great service, great pricing and SUPER CONVENIENT!
# text = I also did not feel like they tried to sell me a bunch of services that I did not need.
# text = Love my home at Creekside
# text = I moved to Creekside Apartments in August 2008 with a 6-month lease and have just extended it for another 13 months!
# text = The management from Julie and Janice to the work staff, esp. Edwin, are just wonderful.
# text = They have been extremely helpful whenever I have asked for help.
# text = Although the apartments are facing Stokes Street and close to the Bascom Light Rail, the location is surprisingly quiet.
# text = I have never had any problems with loud neighbors or concerns about safety.
# text = The apartments are within walking distance to Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, and other stores.
# text = The well-equipped, clean gym is a plus!
# text = Great place to live if you work in and around downtown San Jose!
# text = I interviewed several contractors for a kitchen remodel.
# text = Liberty construction shows up and it's two guys...all I get is 100% sales pitch "We're the best...we're number 50 so we must be doing something right...look at all these certificates that say we're great".
# text = Not once did I feel listened to like they actually cared about what I wanted, all they were interested in was me signing a contract right then and there.
# text = Very high pressured sales and with the reviews of many others bad service.
# text = I'm glad I trusted my gut and didn't get sucked into doing business with them.
# text = Find someone you trust that actually hears you and wants to do the job right.
# text = Don't waste your time or money!
# text = I took my 3 year old son here at the weekend and to be honest, apart from the shark walkway, I thought it was rubbish and overpriced.
# text = Even taking into account the fact that my 3 year old wanted to run most of the way round, it took us just over one hour start to finish.
# text = If you have been to the London Aquarium I would not even bother with this.
# text = If you are really desperate for something to pass the time and are willing to shell out the best part of £30 for 2 two people then go for it.
# text = (For some reason itwill not let me rate it one star - it is not rated 5 by me!)
# text = Cranmore Dental and Implant Clinic : I could not recommend Dr David Nelson enough.
# text = I had a severe phobia of attending the dentist until I met and was treated by Dr Nelson.
# text = He instantaneously put me at ease and his ongoing treatments have been absolutely pain free.
# text = My previous apprehension has been dismissed and I no longer have a sinking feeling when my next appointment is due!
# text = In addition to the core treatment, Dr Nelson has impressed me further with his concern and interest in the well-being of his patients – his dental work underpinned by a strong duty of care to every patient.
# text = He is always prepared to go the extra mile to ensure that any patient discomfort is dealt with immediately –
# text = Pam Gillies
# text = Best Salsa (hehehe)
# text = After my trees were cleaned up, they gave me a jar of salsa.
# text = The owner warned me that it was the best salsa I would ever had, and he was right.
# text = No joke!
# text = I hate to say check them out just for the salsa, but James, I NEED another jar badly :) All kidding aside, they are a very good company, I have a hard time giving any service biz a 5 star review but they came close.
# text = Very affordable (don't call it cheap) and their trimmers were quick and courteous when I got home from work.
# text = And the salsa, be sure to ask for a jar and have plenty of chips around, you will need them.....
# text = Dr. Mann killed our pet
# text = Yea, Dr. Mann ain't so great.
# text = We took our beloved kitty to him and it came back dead.
# text = We live in the sub-division around the corner and after it happened and we brought it up at some neighborhood gatherings we discovered that several people from this neighborhood alone had pets goto Dr. Mann for surgical procedures and came back dead.
# text = If you take him here for shots, no big deal but I would never let this man apply anesthetic to my pet ever again.
# text = Oh, they also charged me for the procedure ($250) AND had the audacity to charge me a $25 'DISPOSAL' fee.
# text = They actually itemized it as a DISPOSAL fee.
# text = AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
# text = One of the worst places
# text = This place and its sister store Peking Garden are the worst places to order from.
# text = the food was horrible not cooked like it should be, they got the order wrong on a number of occasions, and once forgot about my order.
# text = i had to call back up there two hours later and the lady (who claimed to be a manager) said my food was on the way, and she didnt offer to compensate me in any kind of way.
# text = i waited another 30 mins before receiving my food and it was cold.
# text = in my opinon this place should be shut down by the health inspector, and anyone who is satisfied with there service and food has never eaten at a real asian restaurant.
# text = Gone downhill since change in ownership
# text = Sigh.
# text = I used to LOVE this place.
# text = But now that they are part of a chain, service has slipped.
# text = I am waiting longer at BNA for my pickups and last time I parked with them, they lost my car key.
# text = Lucky I had a spare with me!
# text = To date they have not made good by either finding the key or paying for a new one.
# text = (These new car keys are EXPENSIVE to copy, you can't just go to WalMart.)
# text = Go to the website for coupons and join the club -you can get free parking.
# text = However, with BNA offering one day of free parking due to construction of the new rental car facility, it may be cheaper to park at BNA.
# text = Wife and I attempted to adopt a dog and was nothing but frustrating.
# text = We arrived Sunday at about 230 and found a do we really liked.
# text = We were told that we couldn't today because they were closing soon.
# text = I called the next morning to let then know my wife would be driving in.
# text = They gave me the run around and missing paperwork only to call back to tell me someone else wanted her and I would need to come in and put down a deposit.
# text = I work 2 hours away but offered my card over the phone.
# text = They refused.
# text = Terrible communication as well.
# text = At one point they told me the dog had been fixed, the next day it hadn't.
# text = Huge ammount of time wasted time and elevated blood pressure.
# text = College is a Joke and the Salon is a JOKE!
# text = You do NOT learn the things you were promised.
# text = You have to bring in your own models and they have to pay for you to use them if you dont then you can graduate!
# text = Going back after graduating your told you get a discount on services nope you dont.
# text = Going there you learn the school does not care about the services given just about the money.
# text = Beware of the nail program you are not taught to use a nail drill AT ALL you learn the old fashioned way of doing nails you will not be able to do well in a salon!!!
# text = BEWARE!
# text = You can fool people
# text = This store is proof that you can fool people with good advertising.
# text = They convince lots of people that they are a great store, when in fact they are a very average place at best, they are just another big box store like the others.
# text = They offer sales that aren't really sales, mislabeled items that make the item sound like a good deal when it isn't, a bad attitude about return items, and on and on.
# text = With higher than average prices to boot!
# text = So don't get taken in, keep your eyes open if you choose to shop here.
# text = On the other hand, the Richmond Ukrops chain is known for its charity work, its community action, and its interest in the public welfare.
# text = Never again
# text = Don't go here unless you want to sit,order,eat and be asked to leave all in a matter of 20 minutes.
# text = You won't even have time to read the entire menu before being asked to order and if you ask for more time your server will wait at the table.
# text = This is the only place I have ever eaten and been told to leave because other people were waiting.
# text = I was told to take my coffee to go if I wanted to finish it.
# text = Oh, and their liquor license was expired so no Bloody Mary or Mimosas.
# text = Plus the drinks are self service, have fun trying to negotiate the small cafeteria space to get your coffee, juice or water.
# text = Go next door to the Ball Square Cafe instead.
# text = I guess you get what you pay for.
# text = I tried to stay here for a few nights with my girlfriend, so we asked for a single queen bed.
# text = We got there, and we were treated to the free "upgrade" of a room with two double beds.
# text = Since they consider this an upgrade, they let their other rooms fill up and would not change our room.
# text = Then we got put in a room with a huge gap under the door....right next to the ice machine.
# text = We could hear every single thing that happened outside like it was inside our room.
# text = When I finally found someone at the desk who could speak English, they moved our room, but we still did not receive the single queen we had "reserved"
# text = I was thoroughly impressed!
# text = I had a problem with the tile in my bathroom coming apart.
# text = I called a few different businesses in the area to get estimates , they weren't the cheapest I found but very reasonable.
# text = The best part is I got my whole bathroom remodeled for about the same price the other company's were quoting just to fix the shower tile and fixtures.
# text = They had the work done in about half the time quoted which made me and my wife extremely happy.
# text = We have had nothing but compliments on our bathroom when guest come over- who would have guessed that one?
# text = Very nice work and friendly guys too.
# text = Best money I've spent on remodeling ever.
# text = I highly recommend any one considering home repair to give these guys a call.
# text = New training Centre is excellent
# text = The Award Dance Centre has moved from its Holderness Road site to a new complex on Chamberlain Road Hull.
# text = The new Centre has 4 studios planned and now boasts the largest single dance floor area in Kingston upon Hull.
# text = The classes cover all age and skill ranges, with BALLROOM, LATIN, SEQUENCE, STREET, DISCO, LINE DANCING, BALLET, TAP & JAZZ.
# text = It is not really possible to score this school too highly, We would give it 12 out of 10 and 5 Stars across the board Steve & Anne
# text = I purchased a 2-year old certified pre-owned BMW from this dealership.
# text = The night I drove back home, I found that the rear window has some leakage.
# text = (You can hear the wind while driving on highway.
# text = Very likely it needs a new window seal).
# text = I admit that I should have paid attention to this kind of little things while test drive.
# text = (But this is a certified car from a dealer.)
# text = So I brought the car back the second day.
# text = They told me that this is not under warranty and want to charge me $175 just to diagnose the problem!
# text = Who knows how much they want me to pay to fix this thing.
# text = I walked away.
# text = So my advice is that NEVER TRUST THIS DEALER.
# text = STAY AWAY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE.
# text = Perfect Practice
# text = After I had chosen The Fountain Dental Practice they provided a slick and professional service from start to finish.
# text = Everyone was friendly from the receptionist to the surgeon herself, putting me at my ease and explaining the whole process, both initially and then as we went along.
# text = Surgery visit timings were always made to suit me and not them and they gave me the feeling that I mattered and was important to them.
# text = The surgery itself is slick, modern and very relaxed and I always felt that I was in capable hands.
# text = My dental surgeon, Dr. Lucy Nichols is clearly a dental perfectionist and clearly proud both of the work she does and the reputation she has established.
# text = Everyone was so helpful that I cannot wait to go back .....
# text = Peter
# text = Wonderful service for large group
# text = I had my wedding luncheon at this BJs restaurant, and it was one of the best choices that I made.
# text = It was a great deal--we paid a certain amount per person, and my husband and I chose 4 types of pizza and the servers brought out as much as we wanted.
# text = We were also served salad and soda.
# text = We had a large party, about fifty people or so, and yet everything was served quickly and we all had a wonderful time.
# text = Even though we were only supposed to have those specific types of pizza, when guests asked for a different type, it was brought out with no charge to us!
# text = I really appreciate BJs for making that special day even better with their wonderful food and service.
# text = wonderful
# text = I went to ohm after reading some of the reviews.
# text = I go to school in the area and usually wait until I go home to get my hair cut.
# text = I decided it was time to grow up and made an appointment.
# text = Sierra was my stylist and i love what she did.
# text = I have wavy hair and she cut to my hair style.
# text = It was the first time i had left a salon with my hair curly.
# text = Usually they blow dry it out and i have to wait until i wash it to see what it will look like in its natural state.
# text = But she did a fabulous job letting me know what she was doing at all times and styled my hair in a way i could do it at home.
# text = It wasn't completly impossible!!!!
# text = I am definitely going back
# text = After recently relocating to South Bend, we were looking for a delicious, fun, yet elegant establishment for New Years Eve dinner.
# text = We were disappointed with this holiday dinner due to the overall flavor and price of the meal, and accessibility to the Jazz Club.
# text = The meal was extremely overpriced and lacked flavor, especially for being a special NYE menu.
# text = The limited menu had few appetizing options and the NYE special packages were way overpriced.
# text = After our meal, our server found us a table in the jazz club where we were informed it would be another $10/person to stay and listen to the band, despite the fact we had just finished a dinner there and were intending to enjoy their drink list.
# text = This was a less than impressive experience at Trio's.
# text = Run for the hills ... you'll be much better off!
# text = One night was too much.
# text = First room had used tissues next to the bed and I requested it be rectified.
# text = I was then moved to another room around the back where the room was dirty, the shower was dirty with other peoples hair in it, the toilet seat was peeling and rough and the bathroom was full of mould.
# text = I called reception to ask if they knew the state the room was in and was told "This is a Days Inn, not the Hilton" and the receptionist then hung up on me.
# text = To warn you to stay away from this place just isn't enough.
# text = There was not one ounce of caring involved and anyone I can warn about the complete lack of service will be warned.
# text = Grocery and Daily Needs Store
# text = Before using FusionRetail Before installing FusionRetail store was running on a dos based software.
# text = We were having a major problem in maintaining cash.
# text = Being a grocery shop, maintaining 5000 different products was a challenging job.
# text = Managing POS counter without barcoding was really a tough time.
# text = How FusionRetail has overcome these issues ?
# text = FusionRetail helps us to maintain the store in an organised way.
# text = Usage of product barcodes and smooth maintenance of inventory with proper recording of transactions like sale, purchase and returns was never easy before.
# text = How long does it take to train new people at work ?
# text = Billing takes 15 minutes and backoffice jobs takes 1 day's training How fast your support queries get answered ?
# text = Over telephone, immediate.
# text = On call, it takes a day to get our issues resolved.
# text = Can't wait to go back!!!
# text = This is by far the BEST B&B that we have ever stayed at!
# text = We were in Santa Fe for a special event and our hosts rented out the El Paradero for all their guests to stay at.
# text = We could not have been more welcomed, more comfortable or more well fed.
# text = The weekend was perfect in every way, in large part to Sue and her great staff.
# text = Everyone was so friendly and really went out of their way to make sure everything went well.
# text = We can not wait to go back to Santa Fe and to this great B&B...especially my 4 year old, who made friends with Ms. Sue and all the ladies, and has talked about them since we left!
# text = We would highly recommend the El Paradero on your next trip to Santa Fe!
# text = Disatisfied customer, I went through Kitchen Aid and used one of their recommended vendors.
# text = A&E came out, charged $129 fee just to walk in the door.
# text = I needed a part for my appliance, the cost was very high so I said never mind, paid the fee and called a local business for a second quote.
# text = The second vendor charged $55 (less than half of what A&E charges) to come and applied that to the price of the repair service (which A&E does not).
# text = Their quote came in at half the price of A&E for the same work and same part.
# text = Seems to me like A&E charges way more than necessary!
# text = Very disappointed in Kitchen Aid as well, I thought that they pre-screened their vendors for price and quality of work, obviously they do not!
# text = Lovely Nails on Cayuga St. in Lewiston, NY
# text = First let me start out by saying, that I have had very nice pedicures at Lovely Nails on Military Road.
# text = I was very excited that a salon was opening in Lewiston, as I live in Youngstown.
# text = I was in two weeks ago and had the worst pedicure that I have had in my life.
# text = There were four of us and I was taken first by a gentleman.
# text = I put my foot in the water and it was cool.
# text = He did warm it up.
# text = He also hurt my toes will pushing my cuticles back.
# text = If the pedicure lasted 20 mins., that was a stretch.
# text = The other ladies had a similar experience, both had nail polish on a couple of toes.
# text = None of us will be using their services again, which is a shame.
# text = Good Service - Limited Results
# text = Andrew was helpful and knowledgeable about acupuncture re: infertility.
# text = He was willing to talk to me about my specific issues and develop a plan of action.
# text = The office is shared with a foot doctor and it's very sterile and medical feeling, which I liked.
# text = The down side was that sometimes there was a lot of noise in the hallway from other patients/doctors.
# text = I worked with Andrew for 2 months and did acupuncture and herbs.
# text = The sessions were nice and I felt relaxed after them but did not notice any changes with my cycles.
# text = I know it can take awhile for results and didn't expect a miracle, but after 2 months I felt like it was not entirely worth the cost/time.
# text = (I am also a little suspicious of all these glowing reviews...)
# text = Friendly, clean and excellent location
# text = The staff was very helpful, and gave us good advice on day and night time activities.
# text = Common room was comfortable and clean, very good room to read or relax. –
# text = A great breakfast which was included every morning until 9:30am; yummy fresh Parisian croissants.
# text = Comfortable and clean beds, a bit noisy when people were coming in late from a night out, but we didn't mind too much as we were also just coming in from a night out!
# text = The location is really stellar!
# text = It is next to Gare du Nord and a five minute walk to Sacre Coeur which is excellent for shopping.
# text = It is close to bus lines for Opera Plaza, Galleries Lafayette , and the famous flea Market.
# text = We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay at the Vintage Hostel again.
# text = Just Autos Thank you!
# text = Was fast and easy, Just had our car returned this morning, I would recommend these Mobile Mechanics for sure.
# text = They certainly know what they are doing.
# text = The mechanic came to our place and sorted out our cars problems, he explained the problem and was very up front and honest, it was towed to the workshop as the gearbox was not working (he explained it better).
# text = They phoned the same day, confirmed it was the gearbox quoted me the job, I gave the go ahead.
# text = Now my cars gears and brakes have never run so well... ever its like driving a new car.
# text = So yes, I wouldn't hesitate in recommending the team at Just Autos for easy professional car repairs,Thank you Just Autos for your help.
# text = I stopped in today @ Yards Brewery.
# text = I must say, I was impressed with the size of the bar area and lounge, & I liked that you could see the brewery right thru the glass!
# text = I had a sampler of IPA, Brawler, Love Stout & ESA.
# text = All were awesome, & I had a Dogwood Grilled Cheese which was enjoyable with the fine beers.
# text = After my sampler & sandwich, I asked for a pint of there Nitrogen Love Stout, I must say I was impressed, with the great taste & I am a Guiness Lover so coming from me, I think this is better, its less dry & smoother!
# text = If you are in Philly you have to come check this place out!
# text = The only negative I have abou this place is the parking!
# text = I left with a case of BRAWLER!!!!!
# text = Oil Change Disaster
# text = My wife had taken her '07 Ford Fusion in for a routine oil change.
# text = A couple days after the oil change, the engine ran rough, the low oil pressure light would come on sporadically, and the engine would whir loudly.
# text = Turns out the engine had no oil, and when oil was put it, it would just run out of the filter.
# text = There could have (hopefully doesn't have) major damage to the engine.
# text = All of this started after their oil change.
# text = Once they realized their mistake they sent a mechanic and tow truck to my wife's work and towed it back to fix it.
# text = I would not recommend this shop for anything, not even something as simple as an oil change.
# text = Plus they will overcharge you for just about everything, and smile while doing it.
# text = Liars, negative stars!
# text = Took my Cruze in twice for poor fuel economy.
# text = The first time they claimed to get reasonable mpg.
# text = However, they would never drive the car with me in it to prove their findings.
# text = I wonder if they were going down a hill!
# text = They told me to bring it back after 5000 miles.
# text = I brought it back with 9000 miles.
# text = They "finished" the work and told me the car was ready.
# text = I found out they did not even drive the car, stated they looked at it before.
# text = They still would not drive the car with me to show their mpg number.
# text = They also claimed not to see anything wrong with the blower fan (a seperate issue), but when I drove the car home I had the same symptoms.
# text = I will never purchace another vehicle from Vic Canever.
# text = Great Job
# text = I want to say that Mike did a great job for our family in our time of need.
# text = Both my grandparents passed away 4 months apart and Mike was very understanding.
# text = He is very professional in his position as a director and yet he still made time to be compassionate for what we were all going through.
# text = I'm sure its not everyday that a funeral director sees the same family in such a short time.
# text = My grandfather passed away silently in his sleep, and my grandmother passed away after a short struggle with cancer.
# text = Both my grandparents looked as natural as could be expected.
# text = Thank you Mike for all your help professionally and personally.
# text = The Peterson Family
# text = Poor service
# text = If you like the drama described in popular sitcom 'Seinfeld', you will see it here.
# text = We signed our name in about 6:00pm.
# text = There were 3 names before us.
# text = The greeter said there was about 15 minutes waiting.
# text = This sign in policy is posted by the restaurant “no reservation, sign your name here”.
# text = I had to ask the greeter, he explained his reasons with broken English.
# text = I could not understand any his reasons.
# text = I could only take it as they would seat the people they know first.
# text = My conclusion is that you should only go there if you want to wait a least an hour and see all kinds other people being seated before you.
# text = Instructor never showed up!
# text = January 15th -- We were signed up for Saturday's 2 PM class "Beginning Yoga with Brittany."
# text = We even arrived 10 minutes early as the website suggests.
# text = The instructor did not show up!
# text = We waited until 2:25 PM and then left.
# text = There were 2 in our group, and a 3rd person was also in the parking lot waiting for this class.
# text = Well, not much I can say except I'm very disappointed with this experience.
# text = This was our first visit to your studio.
# text = In today's instant world, there's no reason for the instructor not to even have given us a phone call or e-mail if she was going to be late.
# text = As a yoga studio, I'm sure you're all aware that all actions generate karma …
# text = and sometimes karma can manifest itself on a bad review on Google.
# text = Finest??
# text = Really??
# text = I beg to differ.
# text = This place is marginal at best.
# text = Not very welcoming and focused mostly on keeping little kids entertained.
# text = I was not impressed, and quite frustrated at their lack of rating for their courses.
# text = I understand not wanting to put labels like 5.10 on an indoor course, because yes, it is not the same, but some clear understanding of the difficulty of one course to another is nice when you are an intermediate climber looking to improve.
# text = I don't want to waste my time on routes set for children, but I don't want to take on something I can't handle just to strain myself to exhaustion.
# text = Rate the routes, with understandable markings and a more detailed system than easy, moderate, and hard.
# text = Again, a great outing for the kids, a frustration for an out of town climber.
# text = Best DJ's In Town!
# text = Wow!
# text = These guys were the best.
# text = They were thorough, high class, and went above and beyond.
# text = We never had to worry about a thing, and they led the way the whole time.
# text = They asked us things that we would have never have thought of, and took extra time to meet with us when we needed it before the wedding.
# text = Having a team was the best because they kept the flow of the wedding going the whole time!
# text = They may look young but don't let that fool you, as their knowledge of music far surpassed what we expected.
# text = I am a music junkie that grew up in the 80's, and my dad worked for a record label in the 1960's.
# text = So we didn't expect them to even know some of the requests that we asked that night.
# text = They just really know their stuff!
# text = NEVER fear going to the dentist again!
# text = I'm 61 years old and have dental problems my entire life.
# text = By the age of 24 I stopped going to the dentist.
# text = My fear and discomfort from dental work scared me!
# text = It took all the courage I could muster to make an appointment.
# text = At the front door of his office, I nearly turned around.
# text = I considered just leaving after going inside and nearly did.
# text = Doctor Gonzales and his entire staff are the most professional people I have ever dealt with.
# text = They made me feel confident in what they would do, and treated me like a member of their own family.
# text = I never felt pain or discomfort.
# text = The ability to smile and eat again can only be described as a whole new lease on life.
# text = Thank you Doctor Gonzales, Doctor Stout, Eva Marie and the entire staff!
# text = Rocky M. Lange Retired Coordinator, Clark County School District
# text = HORRIBLE SERVICE AND FOOD
# text = not only is this place too expensive for what it is, its horrible!
# text = In the past, I got a steak and there was more fat and rough pieces than there was good steak (and this was the sirloin!), the sides were drenched with butter and the salad was a little on the brown side.
# text = Today we went for a party (during lunch, so the place was empty) with about 25 other people.
# text = It took over 1.5 hours for our food to come out and by that time my 8 month old had it!
# text = Does it seriously take that long for a soup and salad?
# text = I was a waitress for years and a key rule is to serve customers with small children before others, as I was the last to get my food.
# text = I would NOT recommend having a party here or even going here.
# text = Texas Roadhouse is WAY better!!
# text = Spay and neuter service.
# text = I have no doubt that the rescue is wonderful.
# text = But I had my cat spayed through their reduced/free spay and neuter program and the vet they sent us to was first of all a hour and a half away, and 4 days later we had to bring them to our normal vet because the vets at the place in wisconsin did a crappy job and they got infections.
# text = My vet even said it was not my fault it was the vet that did the surgery, So I would not recommend getting that program unless you have an extra hundred dollars or so for antibiotics and a vet visit.
# text = You'd think they would do a good job but they don't care unless they are getting paid full price.
# text = Which is so dumb.
# text = Not to mention the fact that they gave us our cats back not even 30 minutes after they were out from surgery.
# text = Billing Issues...
# text = I had a routine surgery for an ingrown toenail.
# text = My insurance company, Blue Cross/Blue Shield paid the fees and everything was fine.
# text = Then I got a bill for $483.00.
# text = The doctor's office said that payments had been "reversed".
# text = Blue cross has no record of aa reversal.
# text = The office refused my requests to see what they got from BC/BS.
# text = They eventually turned it over to a collection agency and now will not even discuss the matter.
# text = I eventually decided to just pay the balance even though the doctor has already been paid, but now the collection agency is trying to say another reversal of $160.00 has come through.
# text = It was an ingrown toenail.
# text = How much could it possibly cost?
# text = Not only am I being bilked for money I do not owe, the office staff is rude to boot.
# text = I think this office has some serious billing practice issues!
# text = We have been blessed to find Elite Flyers online and would not use anyone else to handle our postcards, posters, etc.
# text = We were looking for a company with decent rates as our company was just getting started.
# text = They have the best rates and GREAT customer service.
# text = On one order, we needed it rushed and shipped to a different state.
# text = They did that with no problem.
# text = I also appreciate their honesty.
# text = I sent a graphic that would have been distorted if printed as it was.
# text = They called and worked with me to fix it so that it would look perfect.
# text = They recently surprised me a larger order.
# text = I ordered 1000 postcards, we normally order 5000 or more.
# text = Because they had room to do 5000, they created the larger amount, and shipped them early.
# text = I recommend this company to ANYONE and everyone that needs great work done at a reasonable rate!
# text = They have a customer for life in us!
# text = sheisters
# text = i made the mistake of buying from these thieves.
# text = I paid 2k cash for a truck with a blown motor.
# text = Their so called mechanic said the engine was good and "There is nothing mechanicly wrong with this truck".
# text = Well I think a blown engine falls under the catagory of mechanics right?
# text = Anyway they jimmy rigged it so i could drive it home.
# text = The next day i took it to 2 auto shops and they both told me the same thing,engine is junk.
# text = I called and got the same runaround on hold and noone calls you back.
# text = From a moral standpoint,you guys are really gonna take 2,000 bucks from someone that needs that truck to work and support his family when you know its just a piece of scrap metal?
# text = If it lasted 1 month i could suck it up but 1 day?
# text = Grimy work you guys do.
# text = Buy your kids somethin nice with my 2k bucks.
# text = Best Stationery store in Bethesda
# text = Papeluna, a cute Mom/Pop custom printing and paper store, just opened a few days ago.
# text = It is right on the hustle and bustle of Wisconsin Ave but some might miss it as it is nestled in between Subway Sandwiches and Modell's.
# text = I popped in after my afternoon pumpkin spice latte break at Starbucks.
# text = It's an adorable little store filled with lots of stationery goodness.
# text = Cards, wrapping paper, paper, and an area to sit down and talk with someone to design your own invitations or for whatever else your custom printing needs may be.
# text = I gave the woman I spoke with today a "You've been yelped!" card to let her know that Yelp may be a good tool for helping spreading the word about Papeluna.
# text = I ended up buying a birthday card and would probably come back for more.
# text = printing, printing, copies, printing, copies, printing,
# text = Watch out for your wallet
# text = Watch out for your wallet!
# text = This company is overpriced for their services.
# text = They pride themselves on being an event and team building company for corporate clients but you better believe they are going to mark you up on that feel good premise.
# text = On a recent event quote that I had done, they came in thousands of dollars over their local competition.
# text = The craziest part is that they aren't even based locally at the city I'm in- they just have 'teams' in areas through the country.
# text = I've spoken to vendors who are used by them who had nothing good to say about the company as well and in fact were afraid to quote events against them even though they openly admitted that they felt Canadian Outback was pricing their entertainment out of the market and doing more to hurt their business than help them.
# text = Be warned- they'll ltake you for everything they can.
# text = Believe me.
# text = This is THE premier university in Virginia.
# text = It is also the largest.
# text = With a Pizza Hut, IHOP, 3 Starbucks, Chilis, Panera, and Chipotle on campus ALONE, VCU has some of the best eating options for students.
# text = VCU has the #1 art school in America, and EXCELS in healthcare and medical schooling.
# text = The Rams, the VCU sports team, also made the NCAA Final 4 this year, too!
# text = VCU also offers high-rise living for students and professors, and the historic yet fixed-up houses in the Fan are also available to students, professors, or even people wanting to live in a safe, viable community.
# text = VCU is also minutes from Downtown Richmond, Canal Walk, Carytown, Stony Point, Short Pump, and the VCU Medical Center.
# text = It is the best university in Virginia and continuously receives rave reviews every year.
# text = The U of R is also recommended, too!
# text = Orr's a nightmare!
# text = DON'T GO!
# text = My boyfriend and I were woken up in the middle of the night at our campsite by drunken kids who'd arrived around 1:00 am and were drinking at the springs.
# text = When we complained to the management (as we were instructed to do if there were any problems), nothing happened!
# text = Then, the next morning, when we, among many other irate guests, asked to speak to the owner, he refused to do so.
# text = Not only that, but he told us, via his manager, that it was our responsibility to get up a second time in the middle of the night and call the night staff if the problem continued, even though his manager did nothing the first time to stop the kids.
# text = Orr is not relaxing, it's not a safe space, and the owner is awful.
# text = To add insult to injury, he refused to refund our money.
# text = Don't go!
# text = FHS is a good high school -- c/o 1998
# text = I enjoyed my time at Franklin High School.
# text = We had relatively good facilities at the time -- decent science labs, with multiple hoods and access to good equipment; nice gymnasiums, and a well-funded music department (I was in the guitar ensemble).
# text = Now, of course, there's a new building, with presumably better facilities.
# text = All to the good.
# text = If I remember, students went to Dartmouth, U.Penn, Duke, BU, William and Mary, Vassar, Howard, and Carnegie Mellon, among others.
# text = Many students went to Rutgers, including their top-ranked pharmacy program.
# text = The point is -- FHS gives you the opportunity to make it to a good college, but you need to work hard.
# text = Absolutely the best little motel on the coast!
# text = I've stayed at this fabulous little motel two years running, and I have to say it's one of the best lodging experiences I've ever had on the coast...and I'm even comparing it to the big resorts I've stayed at!
# text = A large group of my friends and I rent almost the whole motel every year for a weekend, and the experience and stay have always been five-star.
# text = The rooms are SO clean, the managers/owners are the nicest people, the place feels so homey, and the location and grounds are beautiful.
# text = There's a restaurant nearby (walking distance) with a great breakfast, and a market across the street.
# text = The motel is very well maintained, and the managers are so accomodating, it's kind of like visiting family each year! ;-)
# text = I honestly can't rave enough about this place...it's really a hidden gem worth checking out!
# text = My favorite cuban cafe in Orlando
# text = I have been eating Cuban for a long time, sandwiches mainly along with other dishes..
# text = I love Cuban coffee, colada... mmmm anyways I found this place and can't stop going there, I stop in at least once a week and anytime I'm in the area for a Cuban coffee or snack.
# text = The place is chill and comfortable.
# text = They don't speak the best English but enough to get by.
# text = They bake bread fresh daily, they don't press their sandwiches which is the way I like it, and the meat is always fresh.
# text = They have a great lunch special with your choice of meat, chicken, steak, or pork and rice and black beans and fried plantains.
# text = And their breakfast is awesome!!
# text = I cannot describe how delicious the mango and cheese pastries and the omelets are to die for.
# text = Stop in and have a bite you won't regret it.
# text = A slice of heaven in winter park off forsyth!
# text = highly recommended.
# text = I have been going to Warner Family for a number of years and would highly recommend it to anyone.
# text = I've read some of the reviews below and would like to state that yes, like any other doctors office there is sometimes a wait (depending on what other patients are being seen for) and some of the tests and procedures that are ran can be costly (just like they would be for any other medical tests elsewhere if you do not have insurance)...
# text = I have seen several of the providers from the office and have not once been shown anything but care and consideration.
# text = I cant speak for them but any tests or appointments they recommend are probably in the best interests of us (the patient) and you have the ability to decline anything that they suggest to you.
# text = I personally have had wonderful service and if youre truely looking for a FAMILY practice...Warner Family is the place for you.
# text = Not what i expected!
# text = We read the good reviews before going and had high hopes.. but to our dismay it didnt turn out that way!
# text = Very frustrating for a restaurant that has 1 rosette and is supposedly renowned for the service... hmm There was no canape's or amuse to keep us occupied, once we complained about the wait they took us something to nibble on but that took us getting out our chairs and wondering round to do that and it was impossible to get anyones attention.
# text = Scallops were overcooked and the foie gras was cold but the rest of the food was lovely.
# text = On top of that though they tried to charge us service charge just to rub it it....
# text = Wouldn't go back as there are a lot of places A LOT better and cheaper.
# text = Nice selection, very clean, friendly staff!
# text = Hot Iron has become a favorite of our family.
# text = Everyone can get the signature dish with ingredients and spices that they want and have the fun of watching it cook.
# text = The staff are very friendly and conscientious.
# text = They always ask if you have meat in your dish, (for vegetarians like me), they scrub an area of the grill and use separate utensils to cook.
# text = They don't just dump your ingredients on and cook either, but carefully separate meat to the hotter parts of the grill and still manage to keep the veggies from turning to mush.
# text = The selection of meats, veggies and sauces is awesome too!
# text = Every time we go they seem to have a different ingredient or two which keeps things interesting.
# text = Meats are kept VERY cold, seafood smells fresh and the serving bar is VERY clean.
# text = Prices are reasonable, (Kids meals are around 4.99) and Wednesday's they have discount dinner prices, I believe.
# text = Great Cookies, Cakes, and Customer Service
# text = It was my birthday and I had a last minute idea to have a bakery cake instead of one pre-made in a convenience store, but the problem was it was the day before Valentines and when many bakeries turned me down for a plain vanilla rectangle cake, Fiona stepped up to the plate and was able to make a fantastic beautiful cake.
# text = Although I'll have to drive a little out of my way to go there, I'll gladly do it knowing that since she's been astounding to me once before that she'll always be that way!
# text = (Also she has a really great website!
# text = And we bought a few cookies there too, they were fantastic as well!)
# text = She deserves many 5 star reviews!!
# text = Food Craving Gone and Weight Loss at Acupuncture Doctor
# text = I am a college student.
# text = Before treatment, my food cravings were "out of control" which caused me to be stressed out.
# text = I experienced a Definite Decrease in food craving (about 50%) and decrease in stress after the 1st treatment.
# text = I was amazed.
# text = I am now more at peace and my food craving is about 99% gone after only 3 treatments.
# text = Before coming to Acupuncture DOCTOR I was a big baby about needles and only came because my boyfriend's aunt recommended it.
# text = It hurt very little, felt more like pressure than pain.
# text = What I like most about Dr. Liau is that she is very caring.
# text = She talks to you at each appointment.
# text = I can tell she really cares and wants to help.
# text = I am SO GLAD to have found Dr. Liau.
# text = Now I feel more confident wearing my bathing suit in the summer.
# text = An Asset to Richmond
# text = For a long time, one big source of entertainment missing from the Richmond City Limits was a first-run multiplex.
# text = Bowtie has filled that role nicely.
# text = The theatre is in an old brick warehouse, which is a block away from the Flying Squirrels stadium.
# text = The owners of Bowtie manged to add something new while preserving what was already there.
# text = The theatre has greatly improved the surrounding neighborhood.
# text = There's plenty of parking, and I've never had an issue with audience members who won't stop talking or answering their cellphones.
# text = Best of all, there are no ads!!!!!
# text = Just previews and the main feature.
# text = Expect to pay full price, and the theatres themselves are on the small side.
# text = But if you like going to the movies, you should love Bowtie.
# text = The mangers also play a classic movies on Sundays, you can get a beer in the lobby, and repeat customers can get discounts if they have a member card.
# text = A great cinema in a great location.
# text = Thank you, Bowtie!
# text = Craft Wonderland with History
# text = My first visit was so fun yesterday.
# text = I could have stayed all day and not seen all the things.
# text = I am doing origami jewelry and found exactly the right things for earrings and got many other ideas there too.
# text = I bought a beginners quilling set and like making the filigree forms you can make and add to other crafts.
# text = The owner, Jean, has been there 31 years!
# text = What a history.
# text = She is a super sweet, lovable and well-informed woman with a great sense of humor.
# text = I really enjoyed meeting her and happy to learn she comes from Oklahoma and has the values of a solid no bs country girl.
# text = This store is a real gem and has much to offer the serious crafter or the occasional crafter.
# text = By the way, Salmagundi (the store name) means something like smorgasbord; potpourri; motley; variety; mixed bag; miscellaneous assortment; mixture, a variety of many kinds of things.
# text = Great name for a great store!
# text = Shop Local!
# text = Barbara Quimba 1/30/10
# text = the 2010 Genesis is grrrrrrrreeeaaat!
# text = I am a proud owner of a brand new 2010 Hyundai Genesis.
# text = I have never seen this car before until this lady at wal mart had it and she told me she got it here and that everyone was so nice to her.
# text = I asked her who she worked with and she just told me ti was the sales manager.
# text = I took the weekend off and came in and asked for the manager who is Jeff and he remembered her right away even remembered her dog, I was a bit shocked that someone would pay that close attention.
# text = We got to talking and he got me set up and I test drove with Craig and I fell head over heels for this car all I kept saying, " was I gotta have it!"
# text = I thouhgt it would be out of my price range but they really worked with me and now I couldnt be happier.
# text = Jeff and Craig are really good at what they do and know exactly how to treat a customer.
# text = Definitely go see them!
# text = Bait and switch, untrained workers
# text = Called the Bonanza store 2 weeks ago, before I ripped out 350sqft of ceramic tile... was told I would need a "dual head concrete grinder" to remove thinset and make a nice "finished" look (ready for concrete stain).
# text = Was quoted $55 all inclusive of grinder inserts, etc.
# text = No problem, sounded like it's done every day.
# text = Will look beautiful.
# text = Got the tile ripped out, call today, now all the sudden this grinder won't leave a finished look AND it's $125 PLUS around $75 for the inserts.
# text = I can rent another machine for like $60 that will give it a finished look.
# text = So from $55 to $260?
# text = Are they serious?
# text = I feel like they didn't tell me the pitfalls before I pulled out this tile and now that I have no other options they want 5 TIMES the price?
# text = Either these people don't know anything about what they are renting, or worse- they are bait and switching.
# text = One suspects that earlier reviewer works for another laundry.
# text = Outside of parking being at a premium, especially on discount days, The Laundry Tub is not filthy and it's no smaller than any of a dozen laundromats I've been in.
# text = Yes, there are bigger, but bigger isn't necessarily better.
# text = I availed myself of the wash 'n fold service, taking just about a year's worth of dirty clothes in and getting back neatly folded, clean clothes in clear plastic bags (I'd originally brought them in, in six large yellow garbage bags).
# text = The cost was certainly reasonable and I will continue my patronage of The Laundry Tub in the future.
# text = Didn't hurt any that they knew my name by my second visit and greeted me warmly then and on my third visit.
# text = Whereas my answer to the question "Where do you get your laundry done?" used to be, "At the checkout line at WalMart," I can honestly say the answer now is, "At The Laundry Tub."
# text = Thank you!
# text = I recently took a rescue puppy to this Clinic and I was SHOCKED at how well Romeo and My family was treated.
# text = They worked around the clock to ensure that my puppy life was saved.
# text = We have to leave him at the vet for 3 days and I was told to call for check ups as often as I wished that no matter how many times I called I would not annoy them.
# text = lol They where super friendly towards us and treated us like people not walking bags of cash.
# text = In this day its rare to find such wonderful people who CARE , Not the kind of want to make cash.
# text = I would strongly suggest you give them the chance to prove to you that not all people in this world are evil!
# text = I will never go to another vet as long as I have animals.
# text = I live nearly two hours away and yet I will still make the drive to see them!
# text = Infact I look forward to taking my animals to the vet simply because of how my animals and I are treated.
# text = Okay, here's the scoop.
# text = I'ma regular at the HH.
# text = The food is excellent, the serivce is horrible.
# text = I think they're still in the mindset from when it was only smokers sitting around and drinking... not in any hurry.
# text = In my experience the food has been excellent (for the most part).
# text = However, the bartenders/waitresses definately need to be re-trained (if they ever had any to begin with) and learn two things: only chat with customers when other customers are not impatiently waiting and to look around more often to see if people are waiting.
# text = In some cases the result is because of understaffing, in some cases the staff just doesn't care/know better.
# text = They must also get something to keep take-out warm, so it's not room temperature at best when you get it home.
# text = You just have to know what you're getting into when you go.
# text = Nice local pub, excellent food (especially wings), and don't go if you have a limited amount of time.
# text = Trust The Midas Touch
# text = I personally trust this Midas store with all my vehicles, I have been going there for years & would never go anywhere else!
# text = the staff is very personable & actually care about the customers safety rather than taking there money.
# text = This is however a very busy shop but there are appointments available & the staff up front will surely make sure you get back in a timely manner.
# text = I look at some of these other comments & laugh because people think that the world revolves around them!
# text = Like the girl with the fuse problem...
# text = maybe you should understand how the world works & realize you are just like any other person & not put yourself on a pedestal.
# text = I will continue going to Dave at Midas because he is one of the most honest business owners in this town!
# text = When having your car worked on you have to trust the mechanic & this Midas is truly someone you can trust!
# text = We decided to try this place last night because we noticed that it had some interesting things on the menu aside from the usual rolls-- live scallop sashimi, duck breast nigiri with foie gras, panko mussels-- but none of these were particularly great or worth the sticker price.
# text = Additionally we tried the Logan Circle roll, spicy crab and tuna roll, and sweet potato tempura roll ($15, $10, and $3.75 respectively).
# text = The sweet potato tempura roll was actually a great surprise: cheap and delicious, the only thing we tried that I would say was well worth it and a great value (and I never get vegetarian rolls).
# text = The other rolls weren't at all special, especially given their pricing.
# text = The bottom line is that the food isn't great and is relatively high-priced.
# text = The service is solicitous, the atmosphere is nice and mod except the out-of-place flat-screen TV playing football.
# text = But I'd go elsewhere unless the prices are cut.
# text = It's just not worth it.
# text = Don't Expect Sleep or Courtesy
# text = I was booked for 2 nights at this hotel in Oct 2007.
# text = At 3:15 am on night #2, the fire alarm and strobe light activated in my room.
# text = These are not household type alarms.
# text = When they sound off, it is a true audio/visual experience.
# text = I called the front desk and got no answer.
# text = After checking for signs of fire or smoke and seeing none, I decided to just pack up and leave.
# text = The desk agent actually argued with me, claiming that no such alarm had gone off (as if I would make that up?).
# text = He finally admitted that only the 4 ADA room alarms had sounded, so only 4 guests were effected (no big deal to him).
# text = This little drip offered no apologies whatsoever, and even refused to give me the name of the manager until I pressed him for it 3 times.
# text = This hotel is adequate enough, but there is an obvious problem with the staff and management.
# text = Do not go there if you expect to sleep through the night.
# text = Poor Service, Lack of Passion: Do NOT go
# text = I began seeing Dr. Romanick back in 2000 and have seen a significant decline in the quality of care, patient-doctor communication, and just the overall level of services.
# text = The poor quality starts at the receptionist desk, where the staff is very impatient and lack the efficiency I once loved about the office.
# text = It took them nearly two months to complete a simple task, and countless calls from my part due to their lack of response and passion (not that it's a requirement for the job, but it helps to at least pretend to be helpful).
# text = Also, I was promised to have my test results emailed to me, but it never happened, and after a few attempts to get Dr. Romanick on the phone to brief me on my condition, I finally gave up and went to a different doctor.
# text = Please do not go there if it's professional, friendly, diligent medical services you're looking for.
# text = Save yourself the trouble, money and time and visit a more caring facility/doctor.
# text = The moving company is actualy based in Brooklyn, but advertised all over NY/NJ, including Fort Lee.
# text = When the guys arrived (2 hours later than agreed) they told that you have to pay all the tolls they payed coming from Brooklyn and extra $100 for them to drive back from your destination.
# text = That was not in agreement eather, but they realy demand it.
# text = And another $100 for wrapping the furniture.
# text = So totalling $212 just for start before any work started.
# text = Guess what, was not in the initial agreement as well.
# text = I was moving out from 2 bdr apartment and it took for 3 strong guys 6 hours to load a track (from 2pm-8pm).
# text = The only reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 1 or 2, I should admit, nothing was broken.
# text = So I still can recomend them but prepare pay twice as much as they tell you initially.
# text = One more thing, they don't take any credit cards or checks.
# text = You have to pay CASH ONLY before they start unloading track on your destination.
# text = Worst Apartments EVER
# text = We lived here for 2 years, the first year or so was okay.
# text = Then, the more power they gave to Linda, the worse the place got.
# text = We were always having our water shut off, there were always people having parties at the pool, even after it was supposed to be closed.
# text = The pool was supposed to close at 10 and they would have people down there until 11:45 yelling, playing music and do who-knows-what in the dark corners of the pool.
# text = Then, when we moved out, we cleaned the apartment top to bottom, they came back and tried to charge us for two cleaning fees (and we never got our deposit back) and past utilities (that were already paid, we have check numbers and records of this).
# text = Linda is the rudest person you will ever talk to and she sticks up for all of the trashy, rude people that live there, not the nice ones that actually give a crap about respecting others.
# text = Do not live here, you will regret it!
# text = The Worst Experience Ever!!!
# text = I have worked with Ted Jurek at Decor and You, and it started out as a decent experience.
# text = He was referred to me by a friend, who didn't have the best experience with Ted, but said that Ted was able to make up for his lack of preparedness at the end.
# text = I figure I would give this company a chance.
# text = However, after giving a required $500.00 (NON REFUNDABLE) deposit before seeing any plans or ideas, I was sorry I did.
# text = We met a couple of weeks later, Ted was late.
# text = He brought fabric books, and pictures of furniture only, which all came way over budget.
# text = By the time we got to the budget i told him I could work with, there was basically no design.
# text = Just curtains and a couple of accessories.
# text = WHAT IS THAT?????
# text = This company is way too expensive with nothing to show for it.
# text = Please everyone....take heed and don't get caught up in the hype about DECOR and YOU working with every budget...
# text = This is just a way for them to squirm their way into your precious pocket
# text = Horrible.
# text = Horrible.
# text = When we walked in, the person behind desk said: "oh well, you must wait, I am in the middle of something."
# text = After a good few minutes, he asked: "what do you want?"
# text = Somewhere in between his rudeness he asked if we smoked.
# text = I asked if this hotel had smoking rooms.
# text = He immediately said "no, there is a $50 deposit now!"
# text = Sure enough he charged it to the credit card.
# text = When I inquired he rudely replied "in the morning when things are checked out you'll get it back."
# text = I called customer service about it because the website specifically states that there are no other charges at the check-in.
# text = I also mentioned to the reception person.
# text = He responded "we have problem with 'people'".
# text = Imagine a hotel having problems with people.
# text = I finally alerted him to his rudeness.
# text = He said he's had a long and bad day.
# text = We had no choice but to stay but will take this as far as we can.
# text = Don't stay there.
# text = I came to find out the person was the hotel OWNER also.
# text = My friend and I were to stay here for a girls night, catch up on our lives evening.
# text = We live within 20 miles of the hotel and wanted to get away from our responsibilities for the night.
# text = Unfortunalty my husband and I had to put our 13 year old lab down that morning and we were not expecting this.
# text = My friend called the hotel to cancel our room as soon as I called her.
# text = They said that we were to be charged for this room regardless because we did not cancel within the 72 hours.
# text = I called them back a few hours after putting my Bodhi down and they still wouldn't budge.
# text = Times are hard, I know, but they had no compassion.
# text = I called 3 times to talked to a manager, never a call back.
# text = I emailed 4 times, never a response.
# text = In one of the emails I attached the letter from the Vet's that expressed their sympathy, this hotel did nothing.
# text = I even emailed Mackinaw Tourist and nothing.
# text = I am sure this is a good place to stay from reading the other reviews, but if something unexpected happens in your life, they will not care.
# text = FANFUCKINGTASTIC
# text = Ok I am a New Yorker who has been going to school in Oxford, England.
# text = I thought the UK was completely devoid of good NYC style pizza.
# text = I thought to get a decent pizza the only way was at a fancy restaurant, and I have to get a whole pie.
# text = I thought I would have to wait until I went home to NYC.
# text = Well then I went on a trip to Glasgow and was walking around.
# text = I saw this place and it looked like the HOLY GRAIL.
# text = I knew I had found the real deal, big pies, sold by the slice, with the pizzas sitting under the glass in the front.
# text = They have crushed red pepper flakes and oregano.
# text = So I ordered a slice.
# text = It tasted like I just flew back home.
# text = I dunno how they did it, but Scottish friends--- this is THE REAL DEAL.
# text = I congratulated this establishment for doing the research on making NYC pizza because these Scots fcking nailed it.
# text = That being said, I don't know how their delivery service is.
# text = They might want to change the name to reflect the new yorkedness of the pizza, scrummy yummy sounds gimmicky to me.
# text = Good food, good wait staff, poor management
# text = We visited on 7/26/08 for dinner We received a gift certificate for the Mama Mia's on Greenfield Ave.
# text = The food was good, and so was our waitress.
# text = When it came time to pay the bill up front, they would not let me use any of the certificate for a tip (which I have done with any other restaurant I've gotten a gift certificate for.)
# text = I then asked if I could have money back in cash.
# text = The person went to go check with the manager, who was sitting at a table chatting with her friends who were eating there.
# text = Her answer was short and manner rather rude.
# text = Sorry for interrupting I guess.
# text = The cashier was also short, unapologetic and made me feel as I was wasting her time.
# text = There were no other options available (I only brought my check card to cover any overage cost) and she rang it up and applied it to the gift card before telling me about the tip policy.
# text = I will not be visiting Mama Mia's again.
# text = There are other places with food just as good with management that values customers and employees much more.
# text = DINING AT TEXAS ROADHOUSE
# text = TEXAS ROADHOUSE HAS VERY GOOD MEALS, THAT THE MEAT COMES RIGHT OFF THE BONES.
# text = IT HAS VERY GOOD PRICES.
# text = ON A BAD NOTE THE WAITING AREA IS NOT ENJOYABLE OR ENOUGH SEATS.
# text = ALSO, THERE SHOULD NOT BE PEANUTS ALL OVER THE FLOOR.
# text = NEXT, THERE SHOULD ONLY BE ONE PERSON BRINGING YOU YOUR FOOD.
# text = ITS NOT A BIG DEAL BUT I HAD TO TAKE MY SALAD HOME BECAUSE THEY FORGOT TO BRING IT.
# text = I HAD TO ASK THE GIRL WHO BROUGHT MY FOOD AND SHE NEVER CAME BACK TO LET ME KNOW.
# text = I HAD TO WAIT FOR MY WAITRESS.
# text = WHEN YOU FIRST COME IN THE HOSTESS IS NOT VERY FRIENDLY,THERE IS JUST A BUNCH OF WORKERS STANDING THERE.
# text = I WAS THERE ON MARCH 6TH, 2009.
# text = I WAS ALSO THERE OF JULY 4TH 2008, WHEN MY DAUGHTERS BUFFALO WINGS CAME OUT WITH A FLY ON IT.
# text = THE MANAGER CAME OVER AND SAID HE WAS SORRY AND GAVE A NEW BATCH OF WINGS, HE SAID WE CANT REALLY DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THE DOORS ARE ALWAYS OPENING AND CLOSING .
# text = IN MY OPINION SHOULD OF JUST TOOK OFF THE PRICE OF THE WINGS FROM THE BILL.
# text = BUT EVERYONE HAS THERE OWN WAY!!!!!!
# text = Mezza Luna FTW!
# text = their mezza luna's are deffly better than the pizza rolls.
# text = its like a pizza roll, but they just toss ham and cheese inside.
# text = it seems like its healthier too, but its prolly not.
# text = also, you can call em ahead of time, and then go to pick up ur food, or have it delivered**.
# text = that cuts down on teh wait time, cus u can do other stuff while ur waiting.
# text = it usually takes 20mins for a mezza luna, as they have to add pure delicious extract to the mix.
# text = their pizza was a little salty for me, but its still good.
# text = they do that whole thing where you sandwich the pepperoni between layers of cheese for +32 delicious.
# text = anyways, the mezza luna: you should try it.
# text = it runs you about 4 bucks and it deals crushing blows to hunger.
# text = **Edit: Living on campus at Clarkson University, I have had food delivered before.
# text = This was back between '05 and '09 and I don't remember how many times we've had it delivered.
# text = Perhaps they don't deliver anymore, but the deliciousness of a mezza luna certainly warrants a pickup.
# text = My 2004 x-type was getting close to 100,000 miles so it was time for an upgrade.
# text = I sent my wife and daughter over to check out a pre-owned 2009 XF.
# text = Michael Chestney was very pleasant and patient with my wife and she suggested I go check it out.
# text = I went in later that afternoon and met with Michael.
# text = He showed me the car I was interested in and we took a test drive.
# text = I loved the car so we began negotiating my trade-in and the price of the 09 XF.
# text = The entire negotiation took about 20 minutes.
# text = Fair give and take on both sides until we agreed on a deal that was within my parameters and was fair to both sides.
# text = 10 minutes of paperwork and I was the owner of a beautiful pre-owned 09 XF.
# text = I have purchased over 15 vehicles (cars, rvs, and boats) in my lifetime and I have to say the experience with Michael and Barrett Motor Cars of San Antonio was one of the best.
# text = Friendly, knowledgeable, and above all fair.
# text = That's all you can really ask from a car dealer and Michael and Barrett hit all 3.
# text = Thanks for the great deal and the great car!
# text = Identity Theft
# text = Myself and my fiance's identity was stolen from the office staff.
# text = We were told by a detective and asked to check our credit for anything unusual.
# text = Luckily they caught the crooks before they did one on us.
# text = It was a black female that use to work in the office.
# text = She stole the information and gave it to another guy that did all the work.
# text = The other guy was pulled over one day and a cop saw suspicious papers with names and social security numbers on it.
# text = Thats how they were caught.
# text = They both went to jail and a new manager was put in charge of the apartments.
# text = The apartment across from mine belonged to a gang of hookers.
# text = Nobody lived there.
# text = A girl would show up, then a guy in a nice car would show up.
# text = My apartment was usually quiet.
# text = I lived in one that did not face the parking lot.
# text = Parking spaces are just big enough for a Mini Cooper.
# text = It sucked having an SUV.
# text = If I found a spot, I couldnt fit in it.
# text = Gates worked 30% of the time at best.
# text = Bugs were a small problem, nothing too bad.
# text = The best there is in service.
# text = I was recently traveling down I-24 from Nashville with my 3 young children and had a blowout on the southeast side of Murfreesboro.
# text = It was 4:50 when a friend told me to call Bud, he would take care of me.
# text = Not only did they answer the phone at 4:50 on a Thursday, they hit the ground moving!.
# text = They tracked down the only tire that fit my BMW330i in Murfreesboro within minutes and secured it, then they came out, took off my tire (it was a runflat - but runflats don't do you any good if they blow out), and brought it to their shop to change the tire.
# text = They were back quickly considering how far outside of Murfreesboro we were and had us on our way by 6:30 that evening.
# text = Thanks Bud for all of your help and taking time away from your family that evening.
# text = It's without a doubt, the best service experience I've ever had and just to be clear, the price he charged me was the same as my tire guy in Nashville's price for putting on the other rear tire.
# text = I hope I can return the favor in the future!
# text = Alan Grissom
# text = Room ok.
# text = Service and Client base not ok.
# text = I have stayed in this hotel many times, and while it typically offers a decent bang for the buck, its client base largely consists of troubled youngsteers and evictees from the local, not so pleasant hood.
# text = I have never considered this a real problem as I travel without kids and can fend for myself, but when I had to listen to a (non-violent) domestic fight that lasted from 1 AM to 5 AM during my last stay and I found out that the front desk was unmanned during night hours, my choice was to either waste tax payers money by calling for a yet another police dispatch to this hotel, or just get over it.
# text = I chose the later, but approached the front desk about the hotel policy to push over their responsibilities on local authorities, not to mention the good nights sleep i paid for but didnt get.
# text = I was told management would call me back but still waiting for that call.
# text = I will probably stay here again because its cheap and I cant afford a better hotel, but do not look forward to it and would definitely not recommend this hotel for families or single female travellers.
# text = Was there this past weekend and the guy behind the counter yelled at me and my son because we believed he left the grandma slice in the oven a little too long and the cheese got all dried out and the slice tasted more like a cracker.
# text = He preceded to grab the slice off the countertop and throw it into the trash while yelling at me saying, "you do not order what you do not know about" and "you don't know how pizza is made".
# text = It was very upsetting to see this kind of behavior especially in front of my four year old.
# text = He was in the process of making me a pie and when I got home, the pie was the worst I have ever seen.
# text = Cheese was falling off, so oily and greasy.
# text = I think he did it on purpose because of my simple request for another slice of grandma that wasn't so well-done (actually, burnt).
# text = I will never go back to this place and I am reporting them to the better business bureau for such horrible customer relations and basically sabotaging my pizza and taking my $25.
# text = THIS STORY IS 100% TRUE.
# text = That little man who thinks he invented pizza can kiss my *ss.
# text = Long Lines, Silly Rules, Rude Staff, Ok Food
# text = The first thing you notice when you arrive on location is that the waiting line literally goes out the door and spills into the parking lot.
# text = A restaurant with this many patrons willing to stand in line just to order tacos must be good, right?
# text = I mean, that's the way it works at amusement parks: the longest lines are at the best rides.
# text = Well, this may be an exception.
# text = The staff taking your order and "waiting" on you are very indifferent and have no sense of costumer service at all.
# text = I have gotten better results talking to COMCAST customer service than with these folks.
# text = And don't even think about asking to speak to the manager because this guy is, and pardon my French, a jerk.
# text = If you have gotten through ordering, dealing with the rude staff and if you followed the dumb rules, you are finally presented with what you came for..some tacos that are "ok," but definitely not worth putting up with all the hassle.
# text = I suggest you go up to Raging Taco & Raging Burrito a couple of blocks up the street or even Taco Mac.
# text = Wish this was in Saratoga--
# text = We were introduced to Bistro Tallulah by traveler-professional diner who happens to own the Adelphi Hotel and travels the world-- and residing in Paris,London, New York the rest of the year.
# text = SHE KNOWS GREAT FOOD AND DINING EXPERIENCES.
# text = She was dead on-- this restaurant was wonderful--- do not be put off by the one negative review on this page.
# text = I can tell you we were pleasantly surprised -- BT has taste memory and each time back the food was consistently delicious -- same dishes -- were consistent.
# text = Our friend is a world traveler and loves unpretentious dining experiences and inspired food.
# text = This chef knows what he is doing.
# text = Treat yourself and go-- you will go back!
# text = I am a business owner in downtown Saratoga Springs and wish this restaurant was in our town!
# text = The affordable rent makes it possible for an inspired chef to serve his high quality fare at affordable prices!
# text = Unlike Saratoga.
# text = I rrly seek the cehf out to introduce myself-- but the second time we went-- i made a point of asking our wait person to introduce my friend and myself to the chef to tell him just how good our meals were.
# text = Cannot wait to go gain.
# text = -R. Morris .
# text = I think that there pretty good.
# text = First of all, if you call for an appointment they won't tell you to call back a month later so you can then make one.
# text = They also don't tell you that they're going to mail you an "application" to be admitted to be a patient.
# text = I feel that the way some doctors offices work around here is a little bit absurd so I'm happy that these guys don't do those two things in particlular.
# text = Usually you can be seen the same week or maybe the following week.
# text = The doctor did tell me that my male pattern baldness is due to my mothers father because the gene is exclusively passed on through maternal line but that's a common misconception (http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm).
# text = In general I would say that the staff is attentive and nice.
# text = But then again I was nice to them so that could have been why.
# text = Anyhow, after reading some of the other reviews it seems like some of the other reviewers are expecting mircles.
# text = If you want miracles you'll have to go to 21st St.
# text = It's a pretty typical primary care office but for the area it's very good.
# text = They don't do certain things that are really annoying about other offices.
# text = First trip to Canada
# text = I recently traveled to Canada on business and had a most excellent experience.
# text = I work for a large retail company recently expanding our operations into Canada and had to travel to ensure all of our computer network equipment was installed properly and on time.
# text = This can tend to be a stressful experience in itself let alone adding crossing boarders for the first time.
# text = I was very pleased to find my accommodations and the hotel staff to be a very calming and comforting part of my trip.
# text = I found the hotel to be amazingly clean, not to mention very well adorned with many pleasant surprises.
# text = From my first encounter at check in to my regrettable check out I found the staff and facility to exceed my expectation.
# text = I completely enjoyed my whole check in experience and was impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff as well as the accommodations themselves.
# text = I will be traveling in this area in the future and you can be assured that this experience will be helpful in my choice of hotels and Novotel will be my first selection.
# text = Yes the parking can be a challenge but being from NJ I am no stranger to tight corners.
# text = Please pass my appreciation to the Staff and Management for their excellent hospitality and good spirits as it helped make a stressful trip enjoyable.
# text = Favorite place in Tampa.
# text = Update: I had to add to my review.
# text = I was just in last night and had a chance to dine in their new dining room.
# text = AMAZING!
# text = I frequent this resturant on a weekly basis but usally only for lunch.
# text = Well I was in for a treat when I was greeted by the friendly girls at the counter who asked if my wife and I would like to sit in their "new" dining room.
# text = Right away they told us that it was the same great food with the same prices so off we went.
# text = We were greeted again and sat promptly.
# text = After looking at the menu and seeing the new menu items they had, we knew we were in for a treat!
# text = I had the Chicken Parmesan Dinner and my wife had the Shrimp Scampi Dinner.
# text = AMAZING!
# text = The portions were generous enough that we even took some home!
# text = I have to say the value of this place always amazes me.
# text = It's nice to see that even in the economy we can eat a place that has upscale service, amazing atmosphere, and Incredible food, but not break the bank while enjoying it!
# text = Bottom line is that when it's a small privatly owned resturant like this is you can tell that the owners and employees take pride in their product and service.
# text = Well Done!
# text = Great work and honest establishment!
# text = I typically have work done on my Jeep at the dealership, but it is 6 years old now and getting charged dealership prices just didn't seem cost effective anymore.
# text = I had tried out few place around the area and had been ripped off a few times.
# text = I had hear great things about Phet and G&G Automotive so I decided to give him a try.
# text = The service was excellent and personable.
# text = He checked out what I needed to have done told me what needed be fixed before he did any work and did great repair work.
# text = The price was actually lower than what I had anticipated and used to compared to other places, plus he showed me the work he did when I came into pick up the car.
# text = Also, a week after the work, Phet called me up to see how my car was running and to let me know that they had accidentally overcharged me for part of the work and wanted to give me a refund for that amount.
# text = That is just unheard of these days!
# text = I grew up in a small town where you knew and trusted your mechanic and was really cynical about city auto repair shops since I moved here, but Phet has shown that there really are honest hard working mechanics around.
# text = He is my mechanic going forward!
# text = Our company is a high end designer handbag and fashion accessories company, thus we are certainly a niche market.
# text = We had been evaluating SEO providers for quite some time and finally decided to take the plunge with Stuart, and Ulistic.
# text = We made the decision for a couple of reasons.
# text = 1. Social Media.
# text = We were familiar with Search Engine Optimization strategies, but new nothing about Social Media - we just heard that it was the next big thing.
# text = 2. We really liked the fact that Stuart sets defined objectives and we meet once a month to go over our Key Performance Indicators.
# text = How has it gone so far?
# text = Well we have been working with Ulistic for 1.5 months, and have 100 people following our site on Facebook, and our web site, www.designofashion.com has seen a 3 fold increase in traffic, which is significantly beating our expectations - SEO is a process that takes time and to get results this quickly is exceptional.
# text = We are absolutely confident that Stuart's ethical and focused strategies will see these trends continue to grow, and our business will reap the rewards of this program.
# text = Finally, it must be said that Stuart is a fantastic person to work with, because of his solid strategies and equally as importantly because he is a genuinely good person and a great communicator.
# text = Excellent service and quality
# text = I had Hom-Excel replace most of the windows in my Tampa residence three years ago.
# text = The excellent windows have performed without any problems, but that's not why I'm writing my review.
# text = Three weeks ago, burglars tried to gain entry into the rear of my home.
# text = The intruders slit the screen of the window.
# text = Next, they tried to force the window with a pry bar and then to break the window with a hammer.
# text = The window didn't break!
# text = My next-door neighbor heard the noise and turned on a light, thankfully scaring the two miscreants away (they even left their hammer behind!).
# text = I called Home-Excel the next day to order a replacement screen for the window, and was happily surprised when they said that they weren't even going to charge me for the replacement screen...that it would be covered under their guarentee.
# text = Lo and behold, they replaced the screen (which had to be ordered) yesterday and didn't charge me a dime.
# text = Their worker even cleaned 3 of my windows and changed a lightbulb for me.
# text = In this day and age, it is so rare to find a company with such nice workers and such far ranging guarantee policies.
# text = I rarely write reviews such as this one, but they certainly deserve anyone's business!
# text = Friendly staff, but definitely some problems
# text = May, 2009.
# text = We were booked at the Sheraton with a number of other out-of-town wedding guests.
# text = Got put into the wrong room the first night, and were quite surprised to have someone with the same room key trying to get in the door at 1:00 am!
# text = Next day got moved into another room, on the same floor with other wedding guests.
# text = There were 3 adults in our room but towels for only 2, no linens for sofa bed.
# text = In the second room it took 3 tries to get all the towels and linens we requested.
# text = A package and some wedding cards were left in our first room.
# text = They were sent to our second room and had been opened--the ribbon-wrapped present, and all 3 envelopes.
# text = Security in the hotel seemed to be excellent, but we were never given an explanation as to why someone would open these items.
# text = A mid-afternoon "fire drill" was disruptive, putting everyone out of the hotel.
# text = When we called the front desk about an extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside our door quite late at night, it seemed to take the hotel staff quite a while to quiet them down.
# text = The staff was friendly, especially the front desk female supervisor, and seemed to want to help, but too many unusual things happened to make us want to stay there again.
# text = Be Careful Of Who Your Sales Guy Is
# text = I think this place is probably really great especially judging by the reviews on here.
# text = My experience was awful though.
# text = It ALL had to do with the sales guy which was a young 22 year old who had admittedly only been working for 2 weeks.
# text = I was extremely interested in the car and very likely would have bought it, but the sales guy I dealt with ruined the deal.
# text = Essentially, I told him I didn't trust him cause he was a car salesman, but he got so incredibly offended at that statement that he had to go cry to another salesman and compose himself before coming back.
# text = I don't know if the kid had a bad day or what, but I had to sit and apologize about nothing for 10 minutes until he dropped the issue.
# text = After that, I just tried to ignore his lack of professionalism and test drive the car.
# text = I played dumb and asked him questions that I already knew the answers to and he responded with half truths and a few falsehoods.
# text = For instance I asked who owned Mazda and he said with confidence that was GM, which isn't true.
# text = I mean, I don't care if he doesn't know, but if he pretends to know and tells me BS to my face, there's no way I'm going to trust him when matters turn to the price of the car and financing.
# text = The Worst Chinese I've Ever Had
# text = This is by far the worst chinese food I have ever had.
# text = The service stunk.
# text = I called in my order and upon arriving to pick it up, they got my order confused with someone elses.
# text = They helped about three other people before they offered to help me again.
# text = They also got my friends order mixed up and wanted to charger her $10 more than what she had wanted.
# text = She asked for the dinner combo and they gave her two dinner plates instead.
# text = We were standing in the store for 20minutes to simply pick up an order.
# text = Not to mention that the wait staff was about as pleasant as dealing with an angry bull.
# text = They were abrasive and rude - when they were the ones who messed everything up.
# text = We had to throw out about 80 percent of our meals because the food tasted so horrible.
# text = I dont know how it is possible to make orange chicken, sesame chicken and kung pao chicken as well as cheese puffs taste THAT bad but China Delight accomplished that.
# text = The only thing that was edible was the steamed rice and the vegetable lo mein was barely tolerable.
# text = I will NEVER go here again.
# text = Lucky Panda in Willis is a billion times better in service and quality of the meal.
# text = I have no idea how China Delight won number 1 Chinese restaurant in Montgomery - There needs to be a recount on that vote.
# text = Terrible Service
# text = One of the worst experiences I've ever had with a auto repair shop.
# text = We took our vehicle in for a repair to the air conditioning.
# text = Approx 4 months later, the compressor went out.
# text = We took it back in to have it repaired again, and less than a week later the second compressor went out.
# text = We went in for a third visit and they fixed it again, but this time when we picked up the car, the radio and clock did not work.
# text = So for the 4th time in 5 months and the third time in 2 weeks, we brought the car back again.
# text = When we expressed our discontent to the manager (that's right, the manager), did he say he would return some money, did he say he would give a discount on our next visit, did he just say "I'm sorry".
# text = Nope, none of the above.
# text = He stood there and told us how he wasn't at fault.
# text = It was the fault of the parts supplier, and can we imagine how he felt having to put another 2 hours of work in the car.
# text = And what did we expect...that he bench test every part.
# text = At no time during the conversation did the words, "I'm sorry" ever come out of his mouth.
# text = I, nor anyone else in my family, will ever go to Sun Devil Auto again.
# text = Well, unless of course the third compressor he put in the car goes out.
# text = Do not use this company!
# text = I dropped off a sheet metal piece that I needed copied due to th it was needing to be replaced.
# text = I asked if they could copy the piece I dropped off.
# text = They said it would be made exactly like the one I needed to replace.
# text = I picked it up when it was finished and was charge 30.00.
# text = When I got to the job and tried to insert the new piece of metal IT WOULD NOT FIT!!
# text = I took the original piece of metal and rigged it to make due since I had to complete the job.
# text = I took the receipt and the metal that did not fit and asked Pomper for my money back.
# text = The girl at the desk was sooo rude I could not believe it!
# text = She told me she could not use the piece I was returning and the company would only put it in the trash so I could not return it.
# text = I explained I did not get what I paid for.
# text = She asked me to bring the original piece back and I told her I had to use it on the job.
# text = She told me that was to bad she would do nothing to help me since she could not use or resell the piece.
# text = I said I was going to trash it also and could I at least have a credit.
# text = With a smirk on her face she told me NO MONEY IS BEING RETURNED and THAT IS THE WAY IT WAS.
# text = DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.
# text = There are to many people that need our business to have to put up with this unfair treatment!!!!!
# text = I would NEVER recommend this gym to anyone and unfortunately this is based solely on the owner's own unprofessionalism.
# text = When I originally joined in January I only did so because I was told I would be able to cancel the 12 month membership if I was to move away.
# text = I signed up with one of the staff who was very pleasant and professional.
# text = Actually working out there was good - the machines are nice and the classes are fun.
# text = The locker room is certainly lacking - I would never shower or change there.
# text = They need to update the locker rooms ASAP.
# text = Back to my poor rating - I was excepted to medical school and went in to cancel my membership as I was told I could do since I was moving away.
# text = The owner was VERY rude, accused me of not reading my contract, and basically told me to shut up when I was trying to ask questions to further understand the process of canceling my membership.
# text = I was able to cancel it but only after paying a $50 fee (which the staff person who signed me up stated I would not have to pay if I had proof of moving) and being spoken to in a very belittling manner.
# text = I would understand if I was being treated this way by a staff member but the club's actual OWNER?!
# text = Bad for business.
# text = I was appalled.
# text = I will never recommend this gym to any woman.
# text = The equipment and classes aren't good enough to deal with the rudeness from the staff!!!
# text = There are better places on the Cape - FITNESS 500!
# text = The Salon Experience from Hell
# text = I feel obligated to share this story.
# text = Right out of college I called the salon and explained my situation.
# text = Just graduated, just moved, not rich, and starting new job soon.
# text = I never got a price quote over the phone and they take your cc info just to make the appointment because if you don't show up, they'll charge you.
# text = I had this ridiculous celebrity stylist from LA named Derrick.
# text = After he already put product on my hair he said "I should warn you, I'm expensive."
# text = What was I supposed to do, say I can't afford you and walk out with crap all over my hair.
# text = I wanted to be very blonde and instead he pulled my root color throughout my whole hair which is a gross mousey brown.
# text = The other stylists around me kept pressuring me saying he's so wonderful, you're going to love your hair.
# text = $400 later my jaw dropped when the receptionist told me the total.
# text = Derrick did a terrible job, was a complete jerk the entire time, and I had no warning as to the price.
# text = I cried the entire way home.
# text = He then "fixed" it for free but it still looked like crap.
# text = I will never go back.
# text = It was the salon experience from absolutely Hell.
# text = He also told me that he worked on the cast of will and grace and that they were all jerks.
# text = That's my favorite show of all time.
# text = I'm pretty sure for the cast that it was the other way around.
# text = Maybe he didn't do a good job and they told him so.
# text = Absolute Nightmare!
# text = STAY AWAY!
# text = Very unhappy ...
# text = Working with Rod Jacobsen was my first experience working with a CPA, so I did not know what to expect.
# text = That said - he seemed to be doing well enough.
# text = However, then I asked to amend my return to apply a credit I had just become eligible for.
# text = I expected to pay for this service, but imagine my surprise when I received a bill for MORE than what I paid to have the original return prepared.
# text = Asked why, Rod simply told me that he had to research how to do the amendment (it was an amended to show that I had purchased a home - nothing out of the ordinary, one would think) and that took time to figure out.
# text = Well, that was strike one.
# text = I wasn't going to use them again, but I was going to leave it at that.
# text = However, now that I have come to realize that I am going to owe the IRS $6,000+ despite doing exactly what Rod told me to do, I feel I have to voice my opinion.
# text = Last year, after all was said and done, I asked Rod whether my payment structure would leave me with no/little tax liability at the end of the year.
# text = He said yes.
# text = Well, again, I am now faced with a tax bill of $6,000+, all due on April 15, 2010 and all that Rod has to say to the matter is 'well, you won't have to pay a penalty.'
# text = I may not have to pay a penalty, yet, but this is NOT what I had in mind when hired these guys.
# text = In the words of my new accountant, THEY LET ME DOWN!
# text = Bit sketchy, sporadic delivery times
# text = I bought about half of the furniture I own from this place.
# text = Why?
# text = Because they cut me good deals if I paid in cash.
# text = Sketchy, right?
# text = Well they came through and delivered almost all of my items within a few days.
# text = (They even got me a couch pretty quickly.)
# text = The guy who was cutting me the deals and getting me the furniture quickly, Ahmed, was nice and mostly professional, except the semi-sketchiness.
# text = Then one day, Ahmed left the country, not to return for months, WITHOUT informing me.
# text = He also neglected to tell the other person working at the store about a dining room table that I had ordered and that was supposed to be coming in.
# text = The other person working at the store didn't know that I still had this table coming.
# text = I had paid in cash, and he said he had no receipt/record of my purchase.
# text = I came back with the receipt Ahmed had provided upon my purchase, and the guy took forever to copy it but said that he would take care of the situation.
# text = I waited.
# text = And waited.
# text = He never once contacted us.
# text = I've had to pester this new guy several times to ask when my table will arrive.
# text = He kept saying different arrival/delivery dates and didn't seem terribly apologetic.
# text = It has been 3 weeks and I STILL don't have my table (which was NOT cheap, I might add).
# text = Point is: You might be able to get a good deal on some nice furniture -- which I did -- but they're not very communicative and god forbid something goes wrong, you'll have to fight to get it resolved.
# text = Poor Service
# text = Run don't walk.
# text = My experience with Home Delivery Service has been one of disappointment and anger.
# text = If I could give them a lower rating than poor I would.
# text = On August 21st, 2009 I ordered furniture from Hickory Furniture Mart and contracted for HDS to deliver it.
# text = After seventeen days the delivery van showed up at my home minus two pieces.
# text = I was later told they had been left at the warehouse and some future date they would be delivered.
# text = No one will give me a date.
# text = I spent $2300 on the bedroom suite, which was complete and excellent condition on the showroom floor.
# text = Upon delivery it was clear the entire set was damaged: a piece of wood was broke on the headboard; the chest of drawers was missing all four pieces necessary to attach the legs; the dresser back legs were pushed in causing the dresser to lean into the wall; and a nighstand was missing a drawer.
# text = How do you lose a drawer.
# text = After complaining on September 10th to National Home Furnishings, Boyles, the Hickory Furniture Mart and Home Delivery Service the latter finally called me back and said they would be up to pick the dresser and chest of drawers at some future point and at some later point it would be professional repaired and at some later point it would be returned.
# text = The customer service at Home Delivery Service was terrible let alone their promise to proper set up furniture.
# text = So I am in limbo regarding a bedroom suite.
# text = I hope the owners and employees of this store have broken bedroom suites in their homes and furniture sitting in someone's warehouse.
# text = Maybe then they will begin to understand poor customer service and terrible sit up service.
# text = Excellent Driving School
# text = I was involved in a car accident 20 years ago and since then I've been a nervous wreck and haven't been behind the wheel.
# text = Unfortunately, a family emergency required me to conquer this fear.
# text = A very good friend of mine highly recommended the Professional Driving School and I was told to specifically ask for Gerry.
# text = She highly recommended him and described him as the "Saintly Instructor and Simply the Best Instructor there is ....very calm, pleasant and very detailed in giving instructions".
# text = I called the school most probably 10 times before I finally enrolled in a 20 hour package.
# text = I had to cancel my initial lesson 4 times and on the 5th attempt the management was quick enough to associate my cancellations with my fear and finally encouraged me into taking my initial lesson.
# text = Five minutes before my initial lesson, I got a call from Gerry advising me of his arrival and to come down as soon as I was ready.
# text = My heart pounded as I walked down and pounded even faster upon seeing Gerry in an SUV - Lexus!
# text = I thought of canceling the lesson once again because I didn't feel comfortable driving an SUV.
# text = Gerry pleasantly said " since I am already here why don't we give it shot.
# text = I trust you and believe that you'll be able to handle this and all you have to do is to reciprocate!
# text = Trust me and most especially trust and believe in yourself.
# text = Don't worry, I'll take care of you!"
# text = ....... the rest was history!
# text = Here I am now driving confidently on my own.
# text = Gerry, I can't thank you enough for helping me cope with my fear.
# text = To my friend, thank you for your recommendation... you were true to your words in saying Gerry is a "Saintly Instructor ...Absolutely Simple the Best Instructor and Best Driving school there is!
# text = Review on House of Joy Chinese Restaurant
# text = My family and I moved to San Antonio a year ago and have tried almost all of the Chinese Restaurants because we love Chinese food.
# text = Well it took us a while to find one that we liked.
# text = But we don't just like House of Joy WE LOVE IT.
# text = Everything we have gotten there has been more authentic and better tasting than any other Chinese restaurant in the San Antonio area we have been to--and trust me we have been to a lot of them.
# text = We just happen to stumble across this little restaurant one day when we had to visit the Bexar County Tax Office off of Bandera Road.
# text = We stopped in and got some take out and cannot stop going back.
# text = They have the best Egg Drop Soup I have ever tasted.
# text = We also love their Egg Rolls and Spring Rolls.
# text = And every entree we have ordered is perfect.
# text = Everything is always cooked fresh and tastes fresh.
# text = Their prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you receive.
# text = The staff is also just so pleasant to deal with.
# text = They are also quick at getting your order out to you.
# text = You don't have to sit and wait around forever like most places!!
# text = So anyone looking for an Excellent night out for Chinese or maybe just lunch should stop in and try it because I promise you 2 things---You won't regret it!!
# text = and you will go back for more!!!
# text = Karla Ferguson-Granger
# text = PS I have noticed on here that someone left a comment that "all of the nice comments must come from co workers or friends" and I will tell you that I don't know these people except from eating at their restaurant.
# text = We are from Virginia and just moved here a year ago.
# text = So that comment is completely false.
# text = Because we think IT'S THE BEST!!!
# text = and we don't know them except for eating there.
# text = Dr. Strzalka at Flagship CVTS is not a good doctor
# text = I am not sure about the quality of the other doctors there, but i do know from personal experience that Dr. Christopher T. Strzalka is not a man of his word, and is also very CRUEL AND UNCARING!!
# text = He was going to operate and replace my bicuspid aortic valve due to critical aortic stenosis.
# text = I had a surgery date of July 17, 2008.
# text = Then he renigged when he read my Health Care Proxy, even though i agreed to be on the ventilator for 2 months following surgery (as he had twice stated i must agree to).
# text = He later said that by 2 months he "meant at least two months".
# text = Two months and at least two months are totally different things.
# text = He did not even give me the chance to say i would stay on the ventilator longer, which i would have.
# text = A Health Care Proxy is not written in stone and can be changed.
# text = He also never even said he was sorry.
# text = Just said i was inoperable and walked out of the hospital room.
# text = So, therefore, now he says i am inoperable (even though i am not 100% inoperable), and he is letting me die.
# text = I am just middle aged and do not want to die, but thanks to this doctor i have no other alternatives.
# text = I, along with my friends, consider this doctor to be the cause of my death as he is not even trying to save my life by operating.
# text = Even my PA i went to the other day said "it must by comforting to have gone to a heart surgeon like him who will do nothing for you".
# text = He said it sarcastically.
# text = If you want a doctor who will lie to you and say he will operate and then change his mind, and not know what he is talking about when he recommends procedures at other hospitals and says they are what you need, when they will not work for you, go to this doctor...he is the one for you.
# text = What you can learn from the below 'bad experience'.
# text = I would suggest not avoiding Second Home based on the 'bad experience' review.
# text = I'd probably be more inclined to board my two dogs here, seeing that they don't just take every dog coming in.
# text = I've toured this place and was impressed by how clean the place was, and all the options for the dogs.
# text = It's unfortunate that bmil believed that his 'perfect' dog was not given the right opportunity to prove himself.
# text = But I've done hundreds of dog introductions myself (another place, I don't work here), and owners can have unrealistic expectations and views of what they see when their dogs meet other dogs.
# text = Workers who do these introductions look at the interaction objectively; and it's good to see they are able and willing to say no if they feel there would be a problem.
# text = It sounds (according to your own statement) that they had a roomful of dogs, so they must be doing something right - and are keeping those dogs safe from potential problems.
# text = You say you work a lot, and that you have a young dog; so I have little doubt that your dog is just filled with energy to burn; and it is good of you to look for a place to take him.
# text = But not at a risk to other people's pets.
# text = You were clearly given another alternative by Second Home, to board him - which might have given your dog a chance to come and go from Second Home a couple times, getting used to the place and maybe facilitating another attempt to get into daycare later.
# text = No business is going to push customers away without good reason; so isn't it reasonable to think they might know what they're doing?
# text = My dogs are far from perfect, and one of them I believe would be a little much for daycare here herself (at least initially).
# text = Be a little more reasonable with your expectations of a place like this; and maybe don't jump to personal attacks suggesting that they don't want to work hard, just because you bruised your own ego.
# text = Dumbest F'ers ever
# text = I called dominos tonight, it rang forever, I get put on hold twice without saying a word and FINALLY someone says, MAY I HELP YOU?
# text = So I say: I'm at the Radison Warwick hotel in Rittenhouse Square (built in 1926) do you deliver to the Warwick?
# text = They say no, Warwick in New Jersey, Call New Jersey.
# text = I laugh and say, no, that Warwick is in New York, but I'm at the Radison-Warwick.
# text = And he says: You're at Warwick in Pennsylvania?
# text = and I said, YES, CENTER CITY PHILLY, and he says, NO, Warwick is a township, If you're at a Radison in Warwick thats too far, try dominos in Pottstown.
# text = I say, NO, I am at the RADISON WARWICK HOTEL in Rittenhouse Square.
# text = He says: I not know that town, I have to get to work, I'm in PHILLY.
# text = Call dominos in your town.
# text = I SAY LISTEN: I'm at 17th and LOCUST, do you deliver there?
# text = He says, I have to have an exact ADDRESS.
# text = OK, 1701 LOCUST STREET i say.
# text = he says: Why you tell me your in WARWICK TOWNSHIP?
# text = He gives the phone to a girl, she says, I have to have your address, I say, do you deliver to 17th and locust, she says, your exact address, I say 1-7-0-1 Locust, ARe you sure? she asks?
# text = YES I am sure, well, she says, is that ON 17th STREET.
# text = Yes, I say.
# text = 17th, like over by 16th and 15th YES, I say, one mile west of you.
# text = You're at 7th.
# text = I am just south of Walnut.
# text = She says, Is that 17th like over past broad.
# text = YES, I am west of broad.
# text = Broad, I say, is 14th street and I am 3 blocks west of broad and one south of walnut.
# text = Hmmm, she says, Then why are you calling here, we don't go past broad?
# text = Anyway, after much yelling and cussing I hung up, grabbed a cab, and went to Geno's.
# text = Quick to take money but not quick to fix a problem!
# text = B&B came out very quickly to give us our quote back in June.
# text = They were very polite, eager to answer any questions and willing to wait for us to return from vacation to begin installing our fence.
# text = Our fence was installed quickly in August and they had their money and left saying "Workmanship is guaranteed for a year!".
# text = Within a week we noticed one of the boards on our gate splitting where a nail had gone in.
# text = We called our representative who assured me he would call the office and have it taken care of.
# text = We heard nothing.
# text = We then called the office and the man we spoke to said he'd send someone out to look at it but couldn't promise when- two weeks came and went and we heard nothing.
# text = I just called again and was told that workmanship, not wood, is guaranteed for a year- well in my opinion- the wood split due to a nail which is part of workmanship!
# text = She even went so far as to say "Your calling about one board?"
# text = Well- when you pay over $1000 for something you want it to hold up and look good!!!
# text = YES!
# text = I WAS calling about one board!!
# text = I'm very frustrated at this point- it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked (the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through) yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once WAS a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer.
# text = So I figure if they don't want to take the time to fix the fence that they installed then I'll take the time to let everyone I can know about how they treat customers once they have your money!!!
# text = STAY AWAY!!!
# text = YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!
# text = They came in under a lot of other quotes and now I know why!!!
# text = When the fence was first installed I would have given them five stars, now for their poor customer follow-up and unwillingness to fix the fence they have dropped to a one-star in my opinion!
# text = Lots of rules, phantom innkeeper, last minute price was worth it.
# text = I called the "207" number and listened to the same recording loop 3 times before I gave up.
# text = I then called the 800 number (which was answered) and inquired about last minute rates.
# text = They had a room with a $99 rate, which I booked.
# text = The room was supposed to be on the 2nd floor, but they put us on the 3rd.
# text = The email confirmation (which I read in the car) warned about large suitcases, declaring that we are innkeepers, not longshoreman.
# text = In other words, they do not help with suitcases, but they promise totes to help.
# text = However upon our arrival no one there (the inn was open).
# text = So no totes.
# text = Finally a chambermaid stuck her head around the corner from the top of the stairs and told us sternly that we could not be accommodated until 3M, no exceptions.
# text = Then she was gone.
# text = We returned after 3PM, found no one there, and a note from the innkeeper with directions to our room.
# text = Rules in the room: #1) if you drink the soda from the fridge in your room you must prove it by leaving the can in the trash.
# text = If they think you've taken a soda from your room home with you, they will charge you $1.50 per can.
# text = They count the cans in the trash to make sure.
# text = #2) If you take the shampoo products home, they will charge you $8 per item.
# text = #4) Breakfast is 8AM to 10AM.
# text = No earlier and no later.
# text = If you go later, it's all cleaned up.
# text = (By whom, I don't know.
# text = I never saw anyone there.
# text = All these rules are posted in the rooms.)
# text = Snacks: uninspired bread, tea backs, and individual coffee things for a machine that didn't exist.
# text = I put the coffee thing in hot water and settled for a cup of weak coffee.
# text = No wine glasses.
# text = Room was clean, but had a weird, dated, sink/stove combo that didn't work.
# text = Bath was clean except shower stall which had mildew problems.
# text = No tub.
# text = The Inn touts a shower with dual shower heads, but only one worked.
# text = Don't get the rooms off the two kitchens.
# text = They are RIGHT OFF the kitchen so you hear everything.
# text = Free parking.
# text = I'd go back if I could get the last minute rate again of $99, but I wouldn't pay their rack rate.
# text = Quit with the overstatements!
# text = The worst thing that can happen for any restaurant like Zahav is to have too many people write hyperbolic reviews making claims that "everyone" is going to "love" the food, decor and service.
# text = The truth is, in my and my dining partners' experience, this is a fine little restaurant with some unique food.
# text = It's an entirely up and down experience, however.
# text = Now, the best of that unique food comes at the very beginning of the meal.
# text = The salatim salads are the smallest plates I've ever seen placed in front of me (you would most likely think they were condiments if it weren't explained to you).
# text = Though they are mostly excellent, you generally don't get enough forkfuls to know if you really love them.
# text = That being said, the laffa and hummus are out of this world.
# text = Then again, for the three of us who dined together, two pieces of flatbread left us fighting for more, and licking the hummus from our fingers (and yes, those two pieces of flatbread did represent a three-person order).
# text = Dinner was also an up-and-down experience.
# text = The vegetarian dishes and lighter fare were almost always spot-on, while the lamb was often dry and/or overcooked.
# text = The duck was a 65% glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy, crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments.
# text = Dessert was... hmmm, that's interesting, I don't even remember dessert.
# text = I guess that tells you a lot.
# text = Oh, yes, the chocolate semifreddo was quite good.
# text = The warm chocolate cake was very tasty, but served at room temperature, not warm by any stretch of the imagination.
# text = And my--no, I still don't remember what I had.
# text = Service was average, but nothing special, and restaurants that are supposed to be excellent should do a better job of training their waitstaff to be communicative and friendly, not merely capable.
# text = Perhaps had we not gone into this restaurant believing Zahav was going to be golden as its name suggests (and as the many golden reviews seem to attest), we would have enjoyed a decent little expensive experience.
# text = But one should not go here expecting something fantastic, unless perhaps you've never had middle-eastern food before, or succulent duck, tasty lamb, decent portion sizes or actually warm chocolate desserts.
# text = PS) When we called for a reservation, we were told that 5:00 and 9:30 were their only openings.
# text = When we arrived at 5, and left circa 7, there were the same 4 or 5 empty tables surrounding us.
# text = Did they think we were going to feel lucky to get any reservation at all, and therefore be more pleased with our dining experience?
# text = MUST READ - Do not waste your time in this store.
# text = At my appointment the girl helping me was unable to adequately lace up some of the dresses.
# text = They felt like they were going to fall off of me and it was very difficult to see what I would actually look like were I to purchase some of these dresses.
# text = I thought it would be a good idea to see how a few that I liked would look like on a model (by looking the dress up online).
# text = So, as I was leaving I asked for the designer/dress name or style number associated with my top picks.
# text = They said they were "unable to tell me until they ordered my dress".
# text = Hmmm... A person cannot call a company, if you have no idea its name (since the designer is unknown... SUPPOSEDLY), and order a gown without a dress name or style number.
# text = Do other brides fall for this???
# text = They either: a) don't want to give it to me because they don't want me purchasing the dress elsewhere or b) are recreating the dresses themselves (ie STEALING other designers' dress designs and "filling the orders" by their own seamstresses).
# text = I'm no detective but... uhh... seriously?!?
# text = Whatever type of operation they are running, I'm not interested and if you're smart, you won't be either.
# text = What a waste of TIME.
# text = Aside from that little *mystery*, one of the sales ladies was quite comfortable telling me how wrong I was about how another dress that I loved compared to one of her dresses that I was trying on.
# text = Somehow, since she supposedly doesn't know any names of designers/dresses, after I told her the designer and dress name of the one I was comparing, she knew "exactly which dress" I was referring to and disagreed with my observation; she said that the bodice did come as low as the one I had on.
# text = My point: Even if I was wrong, don't sit there and argue with the customer.
# text = Say something like, "Huh.
# text = I didn't think so but you could be right."
# text = Unless you want to take the "tell the customer how wrong she is and try and force her into a dress she's obviously not loving" approach which will likely get you... uh... nowhere.
# text = Seriously: do not waste your time.
# text = Other shops around this city have MUCH NICER and more TRANSPARENT owners.
# text = Not owners that seem like they have something to hide and know nothing about common courtesy and customer service.
# text = I felt very much like Wedding Gallery was being dishonest and I wouldn't trust them to lace me up in another gown let alone trust them with the gown I will wear on the most important day of my life.
# text = AWFUL SERVICE!
# text = After happily visiting Sear's Automotives in the past, I was shocked at the horrible service received at their Greensboro location.
# text = I brought my car in on a Sunday to replace a shredded tire.
# text = I waited about 20 minutes in the store part before anyone was able to assist me and was then told to pull my car into the shop (that is apparently what you are supposed to do, but the big signs pointing you that way are for some reason kept inside the garage, so you don't see them drving up, and they purposely block the front pull-up that all other Sear's use).
# text = Once inside, I had to stand around for at least 10 more minutes before--FINALLY-- a technician got to me.
# text = Once I returned to pick up my car, you can believe I spent quite a bit MORE time standing around waiting.
# text = I had wanted to split the total between a credit card and check card since I was being reimbursed for the tire but was told this wasn't possible.
# text = Once I actually got back in my car, it was dirty and had grease all over the steering wheel.
# text = OK, one bad experience...fine.
# text = The following Friday, I returned with my car to go ahead and replace the other 3 tires, which were worn.
# text = I would not have gone back, but I couldn't find the particular tire they'd used in stock anywhere else.
# text = Once again, I waited for quite a bit before being attended to.
# text = I got the order completed, and then questioned the technician since it came out about $40 less than I expected.
# text = He said it was the same tire, and verified this, after checking both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week.
# text = However, when he printed out the service quote, I could see that it was NOT the correct tire, and was not even an appropriate tire for my car model.
# text = So I pointed this out to him, at which point he said they only had one of the correct tires in stock.
# text = Ok--fine.
# text = So I got just my other rear tire replaced.
# text = They promised it'd be done within an hour, so I waited in the lobby.
# text = Over two hours later (and ten minutes before they closed) my car was finally finished.
# text = A few minutes after I left, I was called and informed that "I" left my wheel lock (which they should have left in the car).
# text = Of course, they would be closing in 5 minutes, so I would have to hurry up or get it the next day.
# text = Of course I couldn't make it back in time (and they apparently could not stay 5 extra minutes to wait for me).
# text = The next day, no one could find my wheel lock and that particular technician was not in.
# text = Of course, they couldn't call him either to ask about it because apparently they don't keep their employees' phone numbers (riiight), so I would have to return on Monday (driving for 3 days now with no wheel lock should I get a flat).
# text = On Monday I called and again it was a big to-do to find anyone who knew anything about it.
# text = Supposedly they will be holding it for me this evening, but I'm sure that will also be a huge ordeal.
# text = The employees at this Sear's are completely apathetic and there didn't seem to be any sort of management that I could see.
# text = I will never return there again (and now have some serious doubts about the quality of work they actually performed on my car).
