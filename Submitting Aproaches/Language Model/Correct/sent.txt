# text = I FIND IT TROUBLING THAT A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT IN OUR COUNTRY THE WORLD'S OLDEST DEMOCRACY WOULD CHARACTERIZE THE MILITARY TAKEOVER AS GOOD NEWS GORE SAID

# sent_id = 183
# text = FURTHER I FIND IT EVEN MORE DISTURBING THAT HE MADE THESE COMMENTS ABOUT A NATION THAT JUST LAST YEAR TESTED NUCLEAR WEAPONS SHORTLY AFTER VOICING HIS PUBLIC OPPOSITION TO THE COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY

# sent_id = 184
# text = A SPOKESMAN FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON ALSO CRITICIZED BUSH'S COMMENTS

# sent_id = 185
# text = IT IS VERY DANGEROUS FOR THIS COUNTRY TO CONDONE THE OVERTHROW OF DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENTS SAID DAVID LEAVY SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL

# sent_id = 186
# text = NOT ONLY DID BUSH NOT KNOW WHO GENERAL PERVEZ MUSHARRAF WAS HE SEEMS TO HAVE CONFUSED COUP-MAKING WITH TAKING OFFICE AND MOREOVER WENT ON TO SUGGEST THAT THE OVERTHROW OF AN ELECTED PRIME MINISTER AND THE INSTALLATION IN POWER OF THE PAKISTAN MILITARY THEN THE WORLD'S STRONGEST SUPPORTER OF THE TALIBAN WOULD BRING STABILITY

# sent_id = 187
# text = MUSHARRAF MADE HIS COUP IN PART BECAUSE OF THE MILITARY'S ANGER OVER PRIME MINISTER NAWAZ SHARIF'S WILLINGNESS TO BACK DOWN FROM CONFRONTING INDIA OVER KASHMIR SO THAT HE EXPLICITLY CAME TO POWER AS A WARMONGER

# sent_id = 188
# text = I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW OMINOUS I FOUND BUSH'S PERFORMANCE IN THAT INTERVIEW

# sent_id = 189
# text = I STILL REMEMBER HIM STUTTERING ABOUT THE GENERAL UNABLE TO REMEMBER MUSHARRAF'S NAME

# sent_id = 190
# text = HE OBVIOUSLY HAD NO IDEA WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THOUGH HE DEMONSTRATED A NUMBER OF ILL-FATED INSTINCTS

# sent_id = 191
# text = HE OBVIOUSLY LIKED AUTHORITARIAN RULE BETTER THAN DEMOCRACY EQUATING DICTATORSHIP WITH STABILITY

# sent_id = 192
# text = AND HE DIDN'T THINK HE NEEDED TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SOUTH ASIA WITH ITS NUCLEAR GIANTS AND RADICAL RELIGIOUS POLITICS THE LATTER A DIRE SECURITY THREAT TO THE US

# sent_id = 193
# text = HE COULDN'T TELL WHEN THINGS WERE BECOMING MORE UNSTABLE AS OPPOSED TO LESS

# sent_id = 194
# text = MUSHARRAF WENT ON TO PLAY NUCLEAR BRINKMANSHIP WITH INDIA IN 2002 RISKING WAR TWICE THAT YEAR

# sent_id = 195
# text = ALTHOUGH MUSHARRAF DID TURN AGAINST THE TALIBAN AFTER SEPTEMBER 11 UNDER EXTREME DURESS FROM THE US ELEMENTS OF HIS MILITARY CONTINUED TO SUPPORT RADICAL ISLAMISM AND HAVE RECENTLY BEEN IMPLICATED IN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS ON MUSHARRAF HIMSELF

# sent_id = 196
# text = THIS WAS THE BODY THAT BUSH PROCLAIMED WAS BRINGING STABILITY TO THE REGION IN FALL OF 1999

# sent_id = 197
# text = SO ONE ANSWER TO BUSH'S CHARGE ABOUT EDWARDS IS THAT IF IT HAD ANY MERIT BUSH SHOULD HAVE DECLINED TO RUN HIMSELF

# sent_id = 198
# text = ANOTHER ANSWER IS THAT EDWARDS CERTAINLY KNOWS FAR MORE ABOUT FOREIGN AFFAIRS NOW THAN BUSH DID THEN

# sent_id = 199
# text = INDEED GIVEN HOW BUSH HAS RAMPAGED AROUND THE WORLD ALIENATING ALLIES AND IGNORING VITAL CONFLICTS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO BLOW BACK ON THE US ONE MIGHT WELL ARGUE THAT EDWARDS KNOWS MORE NOW THAN BUSH DOES

# sent_id = 200
# text = THIS IS WHAT EDWARDS' CAMPAIGN LITERATURE SAID ABOUT HIS POSITIONS EDWARDS BELIEVES THAT THE U S MUST BE AN ACTIVE LEADER TO HELP RESOLVE CONFLICTS FROM REDUCING TENSIONS BETWEEN INDIA AND PAKISTAN TO THE PEACE PROCESS IN NORTHERN IRELAND

# sent_id = 201
# text = EDWARDS IS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF ISRAEL AND BELIEVES THAT THE U S HAS A VITAL ROLE IN PROMOTING PEACE BETWEEN THE ISRAELIS AND THE PALESTINIANS

# sent_id = 202
# text = I DON'T SEE BUSH DOING ANY OF THIS

# sent_id = 206
# text = AS THE AMERICAN PUBLIC GRADUALLY WEARIES OF THE IRAQ CRISIS SOME HAVE BEGUN WORRYING THAT THE WAR COULD BLOW BACK ON THE US BY CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR ANTI-AMERICAN TERRORISM

# sent_id = 207
# text = ISRAEL HOWEVER IS MUCH CLOSER TO IRAQ AND IS LIKELY TO SUFFER FROM IRAQI INSTABILITY MUCH MORE ACUTELY THAN WILL THE UNITED STATES

# sent_id = 208
# text = IRONICALLY AMONG THE STRONGEST PROPONENTS OF WAR IN IRAQ WERE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER ARIEL SHARON AND HIS NEOCONSERVATIVE SUPPORTERS IN THE US

# sent_id = 209
# text = HAVE THEY HOWEVER ACTUALLY WEAKENED ISRAELI SECURITY

# sent_id = 210
# text = THE BIGGEST THREAT ISRAEL FACES IS NOT FROM CONVENTIONAL ARMIES BUT FROM THE ASYMMETRICAL TACTICS OF PALESTINIAN NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS

# sent_id = 211
# text = THE DERAILING OF THE OSLO PEACE PROCESS BY THE HARD-LINE POLICIES OF SHARON AND THE PALESTINIAN INTIFADA HAS ENCOURAGED SUICIDE BOMBINGS

# sent_id = 212

# sent_id = 213
# text = ALTHOUGH ISRAEL WITHDREW FROM LEBANESE TERRITORY IN MAY 2000 THE RADICAL LEBANESE SHIITE PARTY HIZBULLAH HAS NOT BEEN MOLLIFIED

# sent_id = 214
# text = IT IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE SOME 5 000 ARMED FIGHTERS AND THEY HAVE PURSUED ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAELI FORCES TO COMPEL THEM TO WITHDRAW FROM THE SHEBAA FARMS A SLIVER OF SYRIAN TERRITORY THAT ISRAEL ANNEXED AFTER THE 1967 WAR

# sent_id = 215
# text = ANY THOROUGH ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT OF THE IRAQ WAR AND ITS AFTERMATH ON ISRAEL'S SECURITY ENVIRONMENT MUST THEREFORE CLOSELY EXAMINE ITS LIKELY EFFECT ON THE CONDUCT OF ASYMMETRICAL WARFARE

# sent_id = 216
# text = ALTHOUGH IT IS OFTEN ALLEGED WITHOUT MUCH EVIDENCE THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN GAVE MONEY TO THE FAMILIES OF PALESTINIAN SUICIDE BOMBERS AND SO ENCOURAGED ASYMMETRICAL WARFARE IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT HE ACTUALLY POSED A DANGER TO ISRAEL

# sent_id = 217
# text = THE PALESTINIANS WHO HAVE BEEN WILLING TO KILL THEMSELVES TO END THE ISRAELI OCCUPATION OF THE GAZA STRIP AND THE WEST BANK WERE NOT DRIVEN BY ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS

# sent_id = 218
# text = SADDAM NEVER DID ANYTHING PRACTICAL TO HELP THE PALESTINIANS

# sent_id = 219
# text = AT SOME POINTS AS IN THE LATE 1980S HE REPORTEDLY MADE BEHIND-THE-SCENES OVERTURES TO THE ISRAELIS TO ARRIVE AT SOME SORT OF A DEAL

# sent_id = 220
# text = HE DID NOT ALLOW PALESTINIAN RADICALS TO LAUNCH OPERATIONS AGAINST ISRAEL FROM IRAQ

# sent_id = 221
# text = BY THE LATE 1990S IRAQ HAD NO NUCLEAR OR BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS PROGRAM AND HAD DESTROYED ITS CHEMICAL WEAPONS STOCKPILES

# sent_id = 222
# text = ITS RAMSHACKLE ARMY HAD VIRTUALLY COLLAPSED BEFORE THE AMERICAN INVASION IN 2003

# sent_id = 223
# text = IF IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW BAATHIST IRAQ POSED ANY REAL THREAT TO ISRAEL IT IS NOT SO DIFFICULT TO SEE A MENACE IN THE CURRENT INSTABILITY

# sent_id = 224
# text = THE BUNGLING OF POST-WAR IRAQ BY THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION CREATED A WEAK AND FAILED STATE

# sent_id = 225
# text = ARMED MILITIAS MANY STAFFED BY FORMER IRAQI MILITARY MEN WITH SUBSTANTIAL TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE HAVE PROLIFERATED

# sent_id = 226
# text = THE US CHOSE TO ALLY ITSELF WITH SUCH GROUPS AS THE SUPREME COUNCIL FOR THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION IN IRAQ WHOSE 15 000-STRONG BADR CORPS PARAMILITARY WAS TRAINED BY THE IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS

# sent_id = 229
# text = THEY VEHEMENTLY PROTESTED THE ISRAELI ASSASSINATION OF SHEIKH AHMED YASSIN THE LEADER OF HAMAS LAST MARCH

# sent_id = 230
# text = WORSE FOR ISRAEL THE ASSASSINATION DREW A DENUNCIATION EVEN FROM THE MODERATE AND CAUTIOUS GRAND AYATOLLAH ALI SISTANI WHO WIELDS ENORMOUS MORAL AUTHORITY OVER IRAQI SHIITES

# sent_id = 231
# text = THESE SHIITE MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN SUPPRESSED BY SADDAM HUSSEIN'S REGIME BUT HAVE NOW ORGANIZED AND ARMED THEMSELVES

# sent_id = 232
# text = THEY HAVE ALSO REESTABLISHED THEIR HISTORICAL LINKS WITH LEBANESE AND IRANIAN SHIITES

# sent_id = 233
# text = IT IS INEVITABLE THAT MOST IRAQI SHIITES WILL SIDE WITH THEIR HIZBULLAH CORELIGIONISTS AGAINST ISRAEL AND IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT IRAQI SHIITES WILL GET RICH ENOUGH FROM IRAQI PETROLEUM SALES IN THE FUTURE THAT THEY WILL BE IN A GOOD POSITION TO BANKROLL LEBANESE SHIITE RADICALS

# sent_id = 234
# text = SUNNI ARAB FUNDAMENTALISTS DEEPLY SYMPATHIZE WITH THE PALESTINIANS AND WITH HAMAS AND THOSE IN IRAQ HAVE DEEP HISTORICAL INKS WITH FUNDAMENTALISTS IN JORDAN AND PALESTINE

# sent_id = 235
# text = IRAQI CITIES SUCH AS FALLUJAH AND RAMADI WERE ON THE TRUCK ROUTE FROM AMMAN TO BAGHDAD AND SO CAME UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE SALAFI MOVEMENT WHICH IS POPULAR IN JORDAN

# sent_id = 236
# text = SECULAR ARAB NATIONALIST GROUPS ALSO UNIVERSALLY SYMPATHIZE WITH THE PALESTINIANS AND THOSE IN POST-SADDAM IRAQ ARE NO EXCEPTION

# sent_id = 237
# text = WHEREAS SADDAM HUSSEIN'S DICTATORSHIP ENSURED THAT SUCH POPULIST CURRENTS WERE KEPT FIRMLY UNDER CONTROL THEY ARE NOW FREE TO ORGANIZE

# sent_id = 238
# text = AN IRAQ IN WHICH ARMED FUNDAMENTALIST AND NATIONALIST MILITIAS PROLIFERATE IS INEVITABLY A SECURITY WORRY FOR ISRAEL

# sent_id = 239
# text = IF EVEN A MODICUM OF NORMALITY AND SECURITY CAN BE RETURNED TO IRAQ ITS CITIZENS WILL BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE COUNTRY'S PETROLEUM RESERVES

# sent_id = 240
# text = THAT PRIVATE WEALTH CAN EASILY BE FUNNELED INTO AID FOR THE PALESTINIANS AND FOR LEBANESE SHIITES

# sent_id = 241
# text = ISRAEL'S SECURITY INTERESTS ARE BEST SERVED BY PEACE WITH ITS NEIGHBORS WHICH CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY TRADING LAND FOR PEACE WITH THE PALESTINIANS

# sent_id = 242
# text = ARIEL SHARON'S AGGRESSIVE NEAR ANNEXATION OF ALMOST HALF OF THE OCCUPIED WEST BANK AND HIS INDEFINITE POSTPONEMENT OF ANY PALESTINIAN STATE HAVE CREATED UNPRECEDENTED RAGE AND VIOLENCE

# sent_id = 406
# text = THE INTERIM GOVERNMENT HAS PROMISED SECURITY MEASURES THAT WOULD REDUCE THE VIOLENCE ON THE DAY OF ELECTIONS BUT I FAIL TO SEE HOW THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PROTECT ALL 5 000 OR SO BALLOTING CENTRES

# sent_id = 417
# text = ONE REMARK MADE BY SHA'LAN ON AL-ARABIYA TV THAT HE COULDN'T SAY MORE ABOUT CHALABI BECAUSE HE WOULD EMBARRASS HIMSELF AND THE VIEWERS ALMOST MADE ME ROLL ON THE FLOOR

# text = FISTFIGHTS PLEASE

# sent_id = 420
# text = HAZIM AL-SHA'LAN BY THE WAY IS THE SON OF THE LATE SHEIKH OF AL-KHAZA'IL IN DIWANIYA AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REPLACE FORMER INFORMATION MINISTER M S AL-SAHAF IN HIS NONSENSICAL MEDIA STATEMENTS WHICH CAN BE PASSED AS JOKES

# sent_id = 421
# text = THE MAIN KURDISH COALITION LIST PUK AND KDP IS BARELY MENTIONED OUTSIDE THE KURDISH REGION

# sent_id = 422
# text = EVEN THERE MANY KURDS LOOK AND ACT AS IF THEY ARE GOING TO GRAB THE CHANCE TO VOTE THEM OUT OF POWER

# sent_id = 423
# text = I DOUBT THAT WILL BE THE OUTCOME THOUGH

# sent_id = 424
# text = MANY IRAQIS INCLUDING CONSERVATIVE AND RELIGIOUS IRAQIS ARE SURPRISINGLY ROOTING FOR THE IRAQI COMMUNIST PARTY PROBABLY IN AN ATTEMPT TO COUNTER THE INFLUENCE OF ISLAMISTS IN THE FORTHCOMING NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

# sent_id = 434
# text = HE SAID THAT RESISTANCE WAS THE ONLY COMMONSENSE SOLUTION

# sent_id = 435
# text = FIRST DRIVING OUT THE AMERICANS THEN FIGHTING THE SHIA BACK INTO SUBMISSION AS IN 1991

# sent_id = 436
# text = SUNNI IRAQIS CONTEND THAT ELECTIONS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO HOLD UNDER OCCUPATION

# sent_id = 437
# text = LEAVING ASIDE THE FACT THAT THIS VIEWS CONFLICTS WITH OTHER HISTORICAL EXAMPLES IN THE REGION SUNNIS HAVE NEVER OFFERED AN ALTERNATIVE CHOICE WHICH EVENTUALLY LEADS ONE TO GUESS THAT THE OPINION HELD BY THE FALLUJAN TAXI DRIVER ABOVE IS PRECISELY WHAT THEY ARE PLANNING TO IMPLEMENT

# sent_id = 438
# text = I HAD ANOTHER CONVERSATION SOME MONTHS AGO WITH A RETIRED BA'ATHIST OLD-TIMER WHO CLAIMED THAT BA'ATHISTS HAVE THE MEANS TO STAGE A THIRD COUP D'ETAT AND RETURN TO POWER WITHIN 10 HOURS OF AN AMERICAN WITHDRAWAL

# sent_id = 439
# text = ON SENSING MY INCREDULITY TO HIS STATEMENT HE ASSERTED THAT BA'ATHIST CELLS EXIST IN ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND THAT THEY DO HAVE A CENTRAL COMMAND EVEN THOUGH MANY HAVE FORMED SEPERATE CELLS OFTEN UNDER ISLAMIC LABELS WITH THEIR OWN LEADERSHIPS

# sent_id = 440
# text = HE SAID THAT THEY HAVE THE TRAINING AND THE FUNDING AS WELL AS THE SUPPORT OF NEIGHBOURING AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS

# sent_id = 441
# text = I CONCUR THAT BA'ATHISTS AND FORMER SECURITY FORCES ARE CAPABLE OF IMMEDIATELY CONTROLLING AT LEAST 5 OUT OF 18 GOVERNORATES ALONG WITH THE CAPITAL IF AMERICANS ARE TO BE REMOVED FROM THE PICTURE ENTIRELY

# sent_id = 442
# text = BUT I ALSO SEE THAT AS A FATAL MISCONCEPTION WHICH IS DOING SUNNIS HARM BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THE US IS GOING ANYWHERE SO SOON

# sent_id = 443
# text = ANY GOVERNMENT THAT ASSUMES POWER AFTER THE ELECTIONS ALSO REALISES THIS SO NOT EVEN SISTANI IS GOING TO CALL THE US TO WITHDRAW ITS TROOPS DESPITE WHAT HE IS SAYING NOW NOT UNTIL THEY ARE ENSURED THE INSURGENCY IS OUT OF THE PICTURE OR THAT THEY HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE FOREIGN POWER IN THIS CASE IRAN TO BACK THEM UP

# sent_id = 444
# text = THE ONLY HOPE NOW IS THAT FOLLOWING THE ELECTIONS THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WOULD OFFER THE HAND OF PEACE AND RECONCILIATION TO THE DISSENTING PARTIES

# sent_id = 445
# text = I WOULD SUGGEST GOING FOR TRIBAL SHEIKHS RATHER THAN CLERICS SINCE THEY HAVE THE UPPER HAND IN THEIR AREAS AND CAN EFFECTIVELY ROOT OUT ANY BA'ATHISTS IN THEIR MIDST IN RETURN FOR A PROMISE OF SHARING POWER AND AUTHORITY

# sent_id = 446
# text = MANY OF THESE SHEIKHS HAVE BEEN DISENFRANCHISED AND ABUSED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS

# sent_id = 468
# text = AND THOUGH HE'D BEEN A FAITHFUL SERVANT HE WAS NOT SUCH A PLAYER THAT HE COULD GET AWAY WITH THAT

# sent_id = 469
# text = HE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN A CUE FROM ANOTHER BOMBER SOME PESKY DARK-SKINNED FOREIGNERS WANT EXTRADITED CIA OPERATIVE MICHAEL MEIRING

# sent_id = 470
# text = POSADA SHOULD HAVE TOLD ANY INQUISITIVE JOURNALIST AT HIS DOORSTEP SOMETHING LIKE MEIRING TOLD THE SINGLE AMERICAN REPORTER WHO BOTHERED FOLLOWING HIS BLOODY TRAIL FROM THE PHILIPPINES THAT IF THIS HARMS ME IN ANY WAY YOU WILL FIND MY POWER THEN AND YOU'LL FIND OUT WHO I AM

# sent_id = 471
# text = BUT THEN MAYBE THAT WOULDN'T HAVE SAVED HIM EITHER BECAUSE POSADA IS NOT MEIRING

# sent_id = 472
# text = POSADA CAN BE GIVEN UP BUT MEIRING CAN'T

# sent_id = 473

# sent_id = 477
# text = POSADA'S CRIMES ON THE OTHER HAND MUST SEEM LIKE ANCIENT HISTORY ESPECIALLY TO A PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW THEIR HISTORY

# sent_id = 478
# text = AND TO THOSE WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW THEIR CRIMES NOT EVEN THAT

# sent_id = 479
# text = BUT WILL POSADA BE GIVEN UP

# sent_id = 480
# text = I DOUBT HE WILL BE EXTRADITED TO VENEZUELA WHICH IS THE ONLY WAY THAT QUESTION COULD BE ANSWERED WITH A YES

# sent_id = 481
# text = I EXPECT IT WILL BE DETERMINED THAT UNDER STRONG MAN HUGO CHAVEZ POSADA COULD NOT BE GUARANTEED A FAIR TRIAL

# sent_id = 482
# text = THE HOPE MAY BE THAT POSADA CAN SOON BE OFFERED TO A POST-CHAVEZ ALLAWI-LIKE PUPPET IN CARACAS

# sent_id = 2099
# text = WITH REGARD TO A GLOBAL MESSAGE I THINK THAT ONE OF THE KEY POINTS AROUND FUNDAMENTAL OPERATING STANDARDS ARE THAT THEY ARE INTENDED TO BE GLOBAL IN NATURE APPLIED TO EVERY COMMODITY AND EVERY LOCATION WHERE WE ENGAGE IN TRADING ACTIVITIES

# sent_id = 2100
# text = WITH THESE OPERATING STANDARDS IMPLEMENTED WORLDWIDE WE WILL KNOW AS OPERATIONS PROFESSIONALS THAT RISK IS BEING MITIGATED AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO ENSURE ENRON TOP MANAGEMENT THAT THERE IS CONSISTENCY IN OPERATING STANDARDS WORLDWIDE

# text = ARTICLE 6 OF THE GALLUP COMPRESSION SERVICES AGREEMENT WHICH I AM SENDING TO YOU SEPARATELY WITH ECS OBLIGATES ECS TO WORK IN GOOD FAITH WITH CDEC TO ESTABLISH AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM THAT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY HAVE ALERTED US TO PEAK LOADING CONDITIONS ON CDEC'S SYSTEM

# sent_id = 3744
# text = WE HAD A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHEN WE SIGNED THE CONTRACT THAT ECS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THAT BY THE CONTRACT START DATE SO WE NEGOTIATED A FALL BACK PLAN UNDER WHICH ECS IS OBLIGATED TO ASSIST TRANSWESTERN IN DEVELOPING A MANUAL SYSTEM TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME RESULT AND WILL HOLD HARMLESS AND KEEP TRANSWESTERN WHOLE FOR ALL COST AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANUAL SYSTEM

# sent_id = 5973
# text = MY FELLOW AMERICANS

# sent_id = 5974
# text = AS MANY OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD PRESIDENT BUSH HAS NOMINATED A LONG-TIME FEDERAL JUDGE NAMED SAMUEL ALITO TO BECOME THE NEXT MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT TO FILL A VACANCY CREATED BY THE RETIREMENT OF ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE COURT

# sent_id = 5975
# text = UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION THIS NOMINATION CANNOT TAKE EFFECT UNLESS AND UNTIL THE UNITED STATES SENATE GIVES ITS CONSENT AS DESCRIBED IN OUR CONSTITUTION ARTICLE II SECTION 2

# sent_id = 5976
# text = A COPY OF THE CONSTITUTION WITH LINKS BACK TO THE OFFICIAL SOURCE IS LOCATED AT HTTP //LOVEALLPEOPLE ORG/USCONSTITUTIONA TXT

# sent_id = 5977
# text = JUDGE SAMUEL ALITO IS VERY HIGHLY QUALIFIED BY ALL OF THE NORMAL STANDARDS USED TO EVALUATE CANDIDATES FOR THIS POSITION

# sent_id = 5978
# text = HE HAS A VERY HIGH INTELLECT

# sent_id = 5979
# text = HE GRADUATED VERY HIGH IN HIS CLASS FROM PRINCETON UNDERGRADUATE AND FROM LAW SCHOOL AT YALE

# sent_id = 5980
# text = HE HAS A LONG AND DISTINGUISHED RECORD INCLUDING MANY YEARS AS A FEDERAL APPEALS JUDGE THE NEXT LEVEL BELOW SUPREME COURT

# sent_id = 5981
# text = HE HAS ENCYCLOPEDIC KNOWLEDGE OF HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT SUPREME COURT CASES AND HE CAN RECITE DETAILS FROM MEMORY

# sent_id = 5982
# text = HE DEMONSTRATES AN EXCELLENT JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT BEING COURTEOUS MILD-MANNERED RESPECTFUL OF ALL PEOPLE CAREFUL IN HIS WORK METICULOUS IN DETAIL

# sent_id = 5983

# sent_id = 5987
# text = YES IT IS TRUE THAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE WAY THEY THINK HE WILL VOTE ON THE SUPREME COURT

# sent_id = 5988
# text = BUT OTHER PEOPLE DO LIKE THE WAY THEY THINK HE WILL VOTE AND THE ONES WHO FAVOR HIM SEEM TO OUTNUMBER THE ONES WHO OPPOSE HIM

# sent_id = 5989
# text = SO NOW THE SENATE IS GETTING READY TO VOTE SOON ON WHETHER TO APPROVE HIM OR NOT AND AT THIS MOMENT EVENING OF JAN 27 2006 IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAS MORE THAN THE FIFTY-ONE VOTES NEEDED FOR APPROVAL

# sent_id = 5990
# text = THE PRESIDENT IS VERY EAGER TO GO AHEAD QUICKLY AND GET THIS VOTE BECAUSE HE VERY MUCH WANTS TO HAVE SAMUEL ALITO ON THE SUPREME COURT TO BE JUDGING THE CASES BUSH IS INTERESTED IN

# sent_id = 5991
# text = SO THERE IS A LOT OF HURRY-UP PRESSURE ON THE SENATE TO GIVE ITS PROMPT VOTE OF APPROVAL

# sent_id = 5992
# text = THERE IS AN OLD SAYING THAT APPLIES IN THIS SITUATION ACT IN HASTE REPENT AT LEISURE

# sent_id = 5993
# text = SOMETIMES YOU CAN MAKE A BAD DECISION VERY QUICKLY THEN REGRET IT FOR MANY YEARS TO COME

# sent_id = 5994
# text = THAT IS WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN WITH JUDGE SAMUEL ALITO IN MY OPINION BECAUSE HE HAS ONE TRAGIC FLAW A VERY SERIOUS BLIND SPOT IN HIS THINKING WHICH MAKES HIM COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE FOR THE POSITION OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICE HE DOES NOT REALLY AGREE WITH THE SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES BUILT INTO THE CONSTITUTION AND HE IS READY TO START TEARING IT DOWN IN ORDER TO FOLLOW THE UNITARY EXECUTIVE THEORY WHICH CALLS FOR VASTLY-INCREASED PRESIDENTIAL POWER AT THE EXPENSE OF CONGRESS AND THE SUPREME COURT

# sent_id = 5995
# text = AND BECAUSE OF THIS TRAGIC FLAW

# sent_id = 5996
# text = HE WOULD TEAR DOWN OUR SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES GIVING FAR TOO MUCH POWER TO THE PRESIDENT

# sent_id = 5997
# text = IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM WE HAVE THREE BRANCHES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE LEGISLATIVE EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIAL BRANCHES

# sent_id = 5998
# text = AND THE BASIC IDEA BEHIND THE CHECKS AND BALANCES WE HAVE IS THAT IF ONE BRANCH OF THE GOVERNMENT GOES CRAZY THE OTHER TWO CAN HOLD IT DOWN

# sent_id = 5999
# text = BUT SAMUEL ALITO BELIEVES IN A LITTLE-KNOWN CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY CALLED THE UNITARY EXECUTIVE THEORY WHICH SAYS THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND THAT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SHOULD BE IN CHARGE OF ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT THE GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY DOES INCLUDING THE FUNCTIONS OF THE INDEPENDENT AGENCIES WHICH WERE DESIGNED TO BE FREE OF PRESIDENTIAL CONTROL AND THE MILITARY WHICH EXISTS WHICH IS REGULATED AND WHICH IS FUNDED BY SPECIFIC AUTHORITY GIVEN BY THE CONSTITUTION TO CONGRESS NOT TO THE PRESIDENT

# sent_id = 6000
# text = THE MILITARY IS NOT PART OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IT IS A SEPARATE ENTITY

# sent_id = 6001
# text = UNDER THE UNITARY EXECUTIVE THEORY THE LAWS OF CONGRESS AND DECISIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT HAVE NO ACTUAL AUTHORITY UNLESS THE PRESIDENT AGREES WITH THEM

# sent_id = 6002
# text = AND SO CONGRESS AND THE SUPREME COURT BECOME MERE ADVISORS TO THE PRESIDENT WITH NO REAL AUTHORITY OVER HIM

# sent_id = 6003

# sent_id = 9132
# text = THE NEXT DAY I LET HER OUT OF THE BEDROOM SO THEY COULD CHECK EACH OTHER OUT AND THE KITTEN HISSED TWICE WITHIN THE FIRST 20 MINUTES OF MEETING EACH OTHER AND NOW SHE NO LONGER HISSES AND THEY HAVE BEEN PLAYING CHASING EACH OTHER UP AND DOWN THE HALL ROLLING AROUND ON THE GROUND AND PAWING AT EACH OTHER

# sent_id = 9133
# text = ONLY ONCE IT LOOKED LIKE MY MALE CAT WAS BITING AT HER NECK AND THEN HER STOMACH AND SHE WAS MEOWING FAIRLY LOUD AND HISSED ONCE THEN HE BACKED OFF AND NOW THEY ARE FINE

# sent_id = 9134
# text = WERE THEY ROUGHHOUSE PLAYING

# sent_id = 9135
# text = OR WERE THEY ACTUALLY FIGHTING

# sent_id = 9136
# text = HE HAS BEEN BITING AT HER NECK AND STOMACH PREVIOUSLY WHILE THEY PLAY WITHOUT HER MEOWING OR ANYTHING SO IM WONDERING IF HE WENT A LITTLE TO FAR THAT ONE TIME

# sent_id = 9137
# text = ANY ANSWERS HELP

# sent_id = 9138
# text = YOU DID NOT LEAVE THE NEW KITTEN IN THE ROOM LONG ENOUGH

# sent_id = 9139
# text = YOU NEED TO DO THAT FOR A LEAST A WEEK OR ELSE THIS TYPE OF TERRITORIAL FIGHTING WILL HAPPEN

# sent_id = 9140
# text = GIVING THE NEW KITTEN HER OWN SMALL TERRITORY WILL HELP HER TO FEEL SAFE AND WILL GIVE HER A PLACE TO GO TO WHEN SCARED

# sent_id = 9141
# text = RIGHT NOW YOUR MALE IS FIGHTING OFF AN INTRUDER AND HE FEELS THAT ALL OF THE HOUSE IS HIS

# sent_id = 9142
# text = PUT HER BACK IN THE ROOM AND KEEP THE DOOR CLOSED FOR A WEEK

# sent_id = 9143
# text = THEN LET HER OUT FOR TEN MINUTES

# sent_id = 9144
# text = MAKE IT FIFTEEN THE NEXT DAY THEN TWENTY AND SO ON

# sent_id = 9145
# text = THIS WILL DO TWO THINGS THE NEW KITTEN WILL RUB HER CHEEK ON THE FURNITURE IN HER ROOM MAKING IT HER TERRITORY

# sent_id = 9146
# text = SHE WILL START TO CALM DOWN AND FEEL SAFE YOU CAN BET SHE DOESN'T NOW

# sent_id = 9147
# text = SHE WILL BE ABLE TO SLEEP WITHOUT BEING AFRAID

# sent_id = 9148
# text = AS WELL YOUR MALE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THAT HIS TERRITORY IS NOT THREATENED

# sent_id = 9149
# text = WHEN THE DOOR OPENS HE WILL GET THAT THE ONE ROOM IS HERS AND HE WILL BE OK WITH THAT

# sent_id = 9150
# text = THE TERRITORY THING WILL BE SOLVED

# sent_id = 9151
# text = YOUR MALE IS HURTING HER TO PUT HER IN HER PLACE BITING HER SCRUFF IS DOMINANCE AND BITING THE BELLY IS A MOVE CATS USE WHEN HUNTING TO PULL THE GUTS OUT OF THEIR PREY

# sent_id = 9152
# text = THIS IS NOT GOOD

# sent_id = 9153
# text = GIVE THEM TIME TO SET UP THEIR TERRITORIES AND ONCE YOU BRING THE NEW KITTEN OUT PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THE MALE

# sent_id = 9154
# text = YOU HAVE BROUGHT SOMEONE ELSE INTO HIS TERRITORY AND HE NEEDS TO BE REMINDED THAT YOU STILL LOVE HIM AND SUPPORT HIS CLAIM TO HIS SPACE

# sent_id = 9155
# text = THAT WILL HELP TO REASSURE HIM AND HE WILL BE LESS AGGRESSIVE WITH HER

# sent_id = 9156
# text = WHEN THEY PLAY FIGHT THEY DON'T HISS

# sent_id = 9157
# text = IF THEY HISS THEY ARE NOT PLAYING

# sent_id = 9158
# text = IF THEY BITE AND ONE CRIES YOU MUST SEPARATE THEM AND YOU MUST KEEP AN EYE ON THEM

# sent_id = 9159
# text = HISSING IS OK UNLESS THEY START TO FIGHT

# sent_id = 9160
# text = IF THAT HAPPENS SEPARATE THEM AND GIVE THEM TIME APART

# sent_id = 9161
# text = PUTTING THE GIRL IN HER TERRITORY WILL MAKE HER FEEL LESS AFRAID AND SHE WILL RELAX

# sent_id = 9162
# text = GOOD LUCK

# sent_id = 9163
# text = A HISS IS BASICALLY A GET THE F*CK AWAY SOUND

# sent_id = 9164
# text = IT MEANS THEY'VE GONE TOO FAR

# sent_id = 9165
# text = WHEN THEY START BLEEDING THAT MEANS THEY'RE REALLY FIGHTING

# sent_id = 9166
# text = IF THEY'RE GOING KINDA SLOW AND LIKE FAKE BITING NOT BITING AS HARD AS THEY CAN AND FAKE SCRATCHING NOT HITTING AS HARD AS THEY CAN WITH THEIR PAWS THEN THEY'RE PLAYING

# sent_id = 9167
# text = I HAVE TWO CATS AND AT FIRST THEY HISSED AT EACH OTHER BECAUSE CATS ARE VERY TERRITORIAL BUT NOW THEY DO FIGHT AND PLAY

# sent_id = 9168
# text = THE DIFFERENCE IS WHEN THE CAT HISSES THAT MEANS THEY ARE ANNOYED AND THEY WANT THE OTHER CAT TO GO AWAY

# sent_id = 9169
# text = THAT MEANS THEY ARE FIGHTING

# sent_id = 9170
# text = WHEN THEY ARE JUST JUMPING AT EACH OTHER AND THEIR TAILS ARE WAGGING THAT MEANS THAT THEY ARE PLAYING

# sent_id = 9171
# text = I CAN SEE HOW YOU GET CONFUSED THOUGH

# sent_id = 9172
# text = WHAT WAS THE GOAL FOR NORTH VIETNAM IN THE TET OFFENSIVE

# sent_id = 9173
# text = WHEN JOHNSON DEPLOYED TROOPS IN 1964 HE WAS ADVISED BY THE MILITARY IT WOULD TAKE A HALF-MILLION TROOPS ABOUT TEN YEARS TO PACIFY SOUTH VIETNAM

# sent_id = 9174
# text = HE REFUSED TO BELIEVE THEM AND ORDERED THE MILITARY TO WIN THE WAR WITHIN TWO TO THREE YEARS BEFORE THE NEXT ELECTION IN 1968

# sent_id = 9175
# text = HE DID NOT GIVE THEM THE NUMBER OF TROOPS THEY REQUESTED

# sent_id = 9176
# text = THIS LEFT WESTMORELAND WITH FEW OPTIONS SO HE ADAPTED A SEARCH AND DESTROY STRATEGY INSTEAD OF A CLEAR AND DEFEND STRATEGY WHICH IS IN THE LONG RUN THE PREFERRED METHOD OF PACIFYING AN INSURGENCY

# sent_id = 9177
# text = THING IS IT WORKED

# sent_id = 9178
# text = THE ARVN WAS NOT HAVING A BIG PROBLEM WITH THE LOCAL VC THE GUERILLA MOVEMENT THEY WERE BEING CHALLENGED BY THE MAIN FORCE VC WHICH WAS LIGHT INFANTRY AND THE NORTH VIETNAMESE ARMY NVA

# sent_id = 9179
# text = WHEN THE AMERICANS SWEPT IN WITH THEIR SEARCH AND DESTROY OPERATIONS THE COMMUNISTS QUICKLY LEANED THEY COULD NOT STAND UP TO THE US FIREPOWER AND THESE REGULAR TROOPS WERE FORCED TO FLEE THE COUNTRY AND TAKE SANCTUARY ACROSS THE BORDERS IN LAOS AND CAMBODIA

# sent_id = 9180
# text = ALL THOSE SUNNY REPORTS ABOUT THE PROGRESS IN VIETNAM WERE CORRECT THE COMMUNISTS WERE BEING DEFEATED

# sent_id = 9181
# text = HOWEVER JOHNSON WOULD NOT LET THE MILITARY CROSS THE BORDERS AND CLEAN OUT THE COMMUNIST BASES

# sent_id = 9182
# text = HE WAS WARNED THAT THEY WERE BUILDING UP A HUGE ARMY AND WOULD EVENTUALLY LAUNCH AN ATTACK BUT HE IGNORED HIS MILITARY ADVISERS

# sent_id = 9183
# text = THE COMMUNISTS AGREED

# sent_id = 9184
# text = THEY COULD NOT DEFEAT THE AMERICANS

# sent_id = 9185
# text = HOWEVER WHAT THEY HOPED TO DO DURING THE TET OFFENSIVE WAS TO SNEAK PAST THE AMERICANS AND ATTACK THE ARVN IN THE URBAN AREAS WHERE THEY WERE DEPLOYED DOING SUCCESSFUL CLEAR AND DEFEND OPERATIONS

# sent_id = 9186
# text = THE COMMUNISTS THOUGHT THEY COULD DEFEAT THE ARVN CAUSE THE FALL OF THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE WOULD THAN RALLY TO THE COMMUNIST CAUSE AND LEAVE THE AMERICANS STRANDED IN A SEA OF ANGRY PEASANTS

# sent_id = 9187
# text = THAT WAS THE PLAN

# sent_id = 9188
# text = WHAT HAPPENED

# sent_id = 9189
# text = THE AMERICANS DETECTED THE ATTEMPT TO INFILTRATE THE URBAN AREAS AND WERE ALREADY REDEPLOYING TROOPS FROM THE RURAL AREAS

# sent_id = 9190
# text = THE ARVN RUSHED BACK FROM HOLIDAY LEAVE AND COUNTERATTACKED

# sent_id = 9191
# text = WITHIN 24 HOURS EVERY COMMUNIST ASSAULT HAD BEEN DEFEATED EXCEPT IN THE ANCIENT CAPITAL OF HUE

# sent_id = 9192
# text = THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT FALL

# sent_id = 9193
# text = AND THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE PEOPLE

# sent_id = 9194
# text = WHEN GIVE THE ULTIMATE CHOICE THEY RALLIED

# sent_id = 9195
# text = TO THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT

# sent_id = 9196
# text = TET WAS A HUGE MILITARY AND POLITICAL DISASTER FOR THE COMMUNISTS

# sent_id = 9197
# text = THEY WERE CHASED BACK INTO LAOS AND CAMBODIA WITH THE ARVN IN HOT PURSUIT

# sent_id = 9198
# text = THE PEOPLE REJECTED THEIR ATTEMPT TO TOPPLE THE GOVERNMENT AND FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES THE US MILITARY AND THE ARVN HANDED JOHNSON THE VICTORY HE HAD ORDERED THEM TO ACHIEVE WITHIN THE TIME-FRAME HE ORDERED IT

# sent_id = 9199
# text = ALL HE HAD TO DO FOR A COMPLETE VICTORY WAS ALLOW THE MILITARY TO GO INTO LAOS AND CAMBODIA AND FINISH OFF THE SHATTERED COMMUNIST FORCES

# sent_id = 9200
# text = BUT JOHNSON WAS SO OBTUSE HE DIDN T UNDERSTAND HE HAD A VICTORY WHEN IT WAS HANDED TO HIM ON A SILVER PLATTER

# sent_id = 9201
# text = INSTEAD HE PULLED THE MILITARY OFF STOPPED THE BOMBING OF NORTH VIETNAM WITHDREW FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE AND SPENT THE REST OF HIS TERM IN OFFICE TRYING TO SURRENDER TO NORTH VIETNAM

# sent_id = 9202
# text = THEY SCREWED UP BY NOT ACCEPTING HIS SURRENDER WHEN HE OFFERED IT

# sent_id = 9203
# text = THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE NOT HAVING ANY OF IT AND ELECTED RICHARD NIXON TO FIX THE MESS LBJ HAD MADE NOT TO SURRENDER LIKE THE ANTIWAR MOVEMENT WAS DEMANDING

# sent_id = 9204
# text = IN THE END NIXON KEPT HIS PROMISE FOR PEACE WITH HONOR

# sent_id = 9205
# text = BUT THAT S ANOTHER QUESTION

# sent_id = 9206
# text = TO EMANCIPATE THE SOUTH BUT IT WAS A SERIOUS FAILURE

# sent_id = 9207
# text = TO MAKE THE WAR UNPALATABLE TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC

# sent_id = 9208
# text = IN THAT THEY PRETTY MUCH SUCCEEDED

# sent_id = 9209
# text = BEFORE TET THE WAR WAS UNPOPULAR BUT TOLERABLE TO THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS IN THAT THE LOSS OF AMERICAN LIVES WAS SEEN AS THE COST OF SUBDUING THE VC AND NVA

# sent_id = 9210
# text = TET MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE WAR WAS A LONG WAY FROM BEING OVER IF THE AMERICANS THOUGHT THEY COULD PRESERVE THE SOUTH AND THAT THE NORTH WAS PERFECTLY WILLING TO SUFFER GREAT LOSSES TO CONTINUE THEIR FIGHT

# sent_id = 9211
# text = THERE IS A VERY GOOD BOOK ON THE SUBJECT THAT WAS WRITTEN BY GENERAL VO NGUYEN GIAP

# text = BEARDED DRAGON QUESTION

# sent_id = 9214
# text = I JUST BOUGHT A BABY ONE YESTERDAY

# sent_id = 9215
# text = I HAVE A BASKING SPOT LAMP THAT SAYS IT IS A DOUBLE REFLECTOR THAT FOCUSES 35 MORE LIGHT/HEAT AND PROVIDES BENEFICIAL UVA RAYS IMPORTANT TO THE PSYCHOLICAL WELL-BEING OF HIM

# sent_id = 9216
# text = MY QUESTION IS DOES THAT MEAN IT GIVES HIM NOT ONLY THE HEAT BUT THE SUN RAYS HE NEEDS

# sent_id = 9217
# text = I ALSO WAS WONDERING HOW LONG SHOULD THIS LIGHT BE ON

# sent_id = 9218
# text = THE LADY AT PET SMART SAID 4 HOURS BUT ON PLACES ON THE NET IT SAYS 10 TO 12 HOURS

# sent_id = 9219
# text = HE'S GETTING USED TO HIS NEW HOME BUT HASN'T EATIN YET

# sent_id = 9220
# text = I HAVE BEARDED DRAGON JUVENILE FOOD AND FREEZE DRIED CRICKETS

# sent_id = 9221
# text = ANY ADVICE WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED

# sent_id = 9222
# text = THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME

# sent_id = 9223
# text = LET ME TRY TO BREAK THIS DOWN AS SIMPLY AS I CAN DIURNAL ACTIVE DURING THE DAY TIME REPTILES LIKE THE BEARDED DRAGON REQUIRE 3 TYPES OF LIGHT UVA UVB AND HEAT

# sent_id = 9224
# text = ANY WHITE LIGHT EMITTING LIGHT SOURCE WILL EMIT UVA INCLUDING HEAT BULBS THAT'S THE EASY ONE TO PROVIDE FOR

# sent_id = 9225
# text = UVB ON THE OTHER HAND CAN ONLY BE REPRODUCED BY A FLUORESCENT SOURCE

# sent_id = 9226
# text = UVB WILL ALWAYS BE A SEPARATE BULB FROM THE HEAT LAMP UNLESS YOU USE A MVB MERCURY VAPOR BULB WHICH IS THE ONLY REPTILE USE BULB THAT WILL EMIT BOTH UVB AND HEAT FROM ONE BULB

# sent_id = 9227
# text = I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT USE COILED/COMPACT UVB BULBS AS THEY ARE KNOWN TO CAUSE SEVERE EYE DAMAGE AND/OR BLINDNESS IN REPTILES NOT TO MENTION THEY HAVE TROUBLE MAINTAINING UVB OUTPUT OVER TIME

# sent_id = 9228
# text = THE LONG TUBE UVB BULBS ARE BEST LIKE ZOOMED'S REPSITUN MODEL HTTP //LLLREPTILE COM/STORE/CATALOG/REPTILE-SUPPLIES/UVB-FLUORESCENT-LIGHTS-MERCURY-VAPOR-BULBS/-/ZOO-MED-24-REPTI-SUN-100-FLUORESCENT-BULB/ REMEMBER TO REPLACE UVB BULBS ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURERS RECOMMENDATION AFTER WHICH TIME THE BULB WILL NO LONGER PRODUCE UVB EVEN IF VISIBLE LIGHT STILL IS

# sent_id = 9229
# text = SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION NO IF YOU JUST HAVE A BULB THAT SAYS IT PRODUCES UVA THEN YOU DO NOT HAVE THE SUN'S RAYS THAT YOUR BEARDED NEEDS

# sent_id = 9230
# text = YOU NEED TO ALSO PROVIDE A SOURCE A UVB LIGHTING

# sent_id = 9231
# text = THE PERSON AT PETSMART IS VERY WRONG IN FACT IT IS ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO SECOND GUESS WHAT MOST PET STORE EMPLOYEES TELL YOU THEY DON'T HAVE THE BEST TRACK RECORD REGARDING GIVING RELIABLE PET CARE INFO

# sent_id = 9232
# text = UVB AND BASKING TEMP SHOULD BE ABOUT 110 F FOR A BABY 95 F FOR AN ADULT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR 10 12 HOURS A DAY

# sent_id = 9233
# text = FREEZE DRIED FOOD IS NOT A GOOD STAPLE FOOD SOURCE YOU NEED TO OFFER LIVE FEEDER INSECTS

# sent_id = 9234
# text = BEARDED DRAGONS ARE SIGHT HUNTERS THEY NEED TO SEE THE FOOD MOVE TO TRIGGER A FEEDING RESPONSE ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE BABIES

# sent_id = 9235
# text = LIVE FOOD IS ALSO HIGHER IN NUTRITIONAL VALUE THAN FREEZE DRIED

# sent_id = 9236
# text = CRICKETS SILK WORMS PHOENIX WORMS AND VARIOUS FEEDER ROACHES LIKE RED-LOBSTER TURKISTAN AND DUBIA ARE GOOD EXAMPLE OF STAPLE INSECTS TO OFFER YOUR BEARDED

# sent_id = 9237

# sent_id = 9243
# text = EITHER WAY YOU ALSO NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE TEMPERATURE IF YOU ARE USING A DRY FISH TANK AS UV LIGHTS IN MY EXPERIENCE UP THE TEMPERATURE SIGNIFICANTLY AND WITHOUT PROPER VENTILATION IT CAN BECOME AN OVEN

# sent_id = 9244

# sent_id = 9346

# sent_id = 9396
# text = I PREFER DARKER COLORS BECAUSE I CAN SEE THEIR EGGS MORE EASILY AND THE FISH LOOK BETTER NEXT TO THEM

# sent_id = 9397
# text = USE A WELL RINSED MEDICINE VIAL A CORK NEW FISHING BOBBER OR EVEN A PIECE OF NON-CRUMBLY STYROFOAM TO FLOAT THEM

# sent_id = 9398
# text = THERE ARE A COUPLE WAYS ONE COULD SPAWN LINEATUS MOP SPAWNING & WATER INCUBATING THEM FOR TWO WEEKS PICKING EGGS FROM A MOP & PUTTING THEM IN A TRAY OF TREATED SEASONED WATER OR SETTING UP THE PARENTS IN A PLANTED TANK & MOVING THEM SO THE FRY CAN HATCH OUT THERE

# sent_id = 9399
# text = IF YOU HAVE THE ROOM TO SEPARATE THE MALE S & FEMALES S & FEED THEM WELL ON LIVE FOODS ASSUMING THAT YOU ARE DOING WEEKLY 50 WATER CHANGES WHEN YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER THEY WILL LEAVE A LOT MORE EGGS

# sent_id = 9407
# text = THE CHLORINE AND AMMONIA CHORAMINE ARE NOT GOOD FOR THE EGGS

# sent_id = 9408
# text = IRONICALLY SOMETIMES IT IS WISE TO LEAVE THE NEWLY PICKED EGGS IN FRESH TAP WATER WITH SOME CHLORINATION TO KILL MICROSCOPIC CRITTERS THAT RIDE IN WITH THE EGGS

# sent_id = 9409
# text = THEN PUT THE EGGS IN WATER TREATED A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE WITH A WATER TREATMENT AND LEFT OPEN TO BREATHE

# sent_id = 9410

# sent_id = 9421
# text = A NUMBER OF MINERALS ARE NOT OF MUCH CONSEQUENCE

# sent_id = 9422

# sent_id = 9429
# text = ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT SOMETIMES BAD EGGS WILL FUNGUS AND THE FUNGUS WILL SPREAD OUT AND KILL ALL THE EGGS

# sent_id = 9430
# text = SOME PEOPLE PUT IN A VERY DILUTE ACRIFLAVEN SOLUTION TO SLOW DOWN THE FUNGUS SO ONE CAN TAKE WHITE EGGS OUT WITH A PIPETTE OR EYEDROPPER

# sent_id = 9431

# text = RIGHT

# sent_id = 9522
# text = ANYWAY SO HE ENDED UP LEAVING ONE NAIL OUT OF MY HORSES FOOT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A FARRIER DOING THIS AND TELLING ME TO CALL HIM IN A FEW DAYS FIRST IT WAS A WEEK THEN IT WAS A FEW DAYS LOL AND HE'D COME BACK OUT AND PUT IT IN

# sent_id = 9523
# text = HE TOLD ME TO REMEMBER TO CALL LIKE 3 TIMES BEFORE HE LEFT

# sent_id = 9524

# sent_id = 9533
# text = OK WELL AS FAR AS HIM BEING A BAD FARRIER FOR LEAVING A NAIL OUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE THEY ARE EXTREMELY WELL KNOWN FARRIERS IN THE AREA

# sent_id = 9534
# text = I WOULD BE A LOT MORE CONCERNED IF THE SHOE FELL OFF BECAUSE IT WAS MISSING ONE LOUSY NAIL

# sent_id = 9535
# text = THE REASON HE SAID HE DIDN'T PUT THAT NAIL IN WAS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO RISK IT WITH MY HORSE'S HORRIBLE FEET

# sent_id = 9536
# text = THIS IS ABOUT THE FOURTH TIME THEY'VE DONE MY HORSE'S FEET BECAUSE I JUST SWITCHED BACK TO THEM

# sent_id = 9537
# text = THE ONLY REASON I SWITCHED AWAY FROM THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE IS BECAUSE MY GOOD FRIEND WHO APPRENTICED WITH THEM WAS STARTING OUT ON HIS OWN

# sent_id = 9538
# text = HOWEVER HE LEFT MY HORSE WITHOUT A SHOE FOR TWO WEEKS NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL A CRAP FARRIER

# sent_id = 9539
# text = WHICH I MIGHT ADD IS THE SAME FOOT THAT KEEPS CRUMBLING WITH THE NAILS

# sent_id = 9540
# text = SO OBVIOUSLY I SWITCHED BACK TO THESE GUYS

# sent_id = 9541
# text = OK CALM DOWN IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S SOME STRANGER THAT CAME UP AND GROPED ME LOL

# text = TO ANSWER BARRY WHITE YES THAT DID OCCUR TO ME I HOPE THAT IS ALL HE'S WAITING FOR

# sent_id = 9547
# text = ON THE OTHER HAND HE COULD VERY EASILY JUST CALL ME AND SAY HEY I'M BUSY RIGHT NOW I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I CAN COME OUT

# sent_id = 9548
# text = AND AS FAR AS SCHEDULED VISITS GO I HAVE NO IDEA

# sent_id = 9549
# text = I'VE NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE THOUGH EITHER

# sent_id = 9550

# text = IF I WERE YOU I WOULD GO

# sent_id = 9559
# text = I WOULD SAY IF HE DOES NOT CALL YOU BACK BY FRIDAY CALL HIM AGAIN HE COULD BE PLAYING HARD TO GET

# sent_id = 9560
# text = I THINK HE LEFT THE NAIL OUT OF THE SHOE AS A EXCUSE TO COME BACK AND SEE YOU HEY HE MAY BE YOUR PRINCE CHARMING

# sent_id = 9561
# text = EDIT I REALLY DONT THINK YOUR HORSE IS IN DANGER OF BEING HURT WITH ONE NAIL MISSING

# sent_id = 9562
# text = I HAVE SEEN HORSES LOOSE NAILS ON THERE OWN AND DO JUST FINE WITH ONE NAIL GONE NOW IF HE HAD LEFT OUT 2 OR 3 I WOULD BE WONDERING TO

# sent_id = 9563
# text = I REALLY DO BELIVE HE LEFT THE NAIL OUT BECUSE OF THE HORSES HOOF CONDITION AND ITS A ADDED BONUS HE WOULD GET TO SEE HER AGAIN

# sent_id = 9564
# text = WHEN I WAS YOUNGER IN MY EARLY 20S MY FARRIER WAS A HOTTIE NAMED JOBY FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW I AM A GIRL READ MY BIO ON MY PAGE DUMB AS A POST ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT HORSES

# sent_id = 9565
# text = HE WAS IN HIS 30S DIVORCED AND HAD 2 KIDS BUT WE BOTH FLIRTED HORRIBLY WITH EACH OTHER BUT NEITHER ONE OF US TOOK THE CHANCE AND ASKED TO OTHER ON A DATE

# sent_id = 9566
# text = SORTA WONDER WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE

# sent_id = 9567
# text = BUT THAT WAS YEARS AGO

# sent_id = 9568
# text = HE HAD THIS HABIT OF TELLING YOU EVERYTHING

# sent_id = 9569
# text = WELL ONE DAY HE SAID TO ME YOU KNOW I DON'T WEAR UNDERWEAR AS HE WAS BENT OVER WORKING ON MY MARES RIGHT FRONT HOOF AND I WAS LIKE UMMMM OKAY

# sent_id = 9570
# text = IM GLAD HIS BUTT WAS FACING ME SO HE COULDN'T SEE MY RED FACE I THINK MY MARE WAS EVEN LAUGHING

# sent_id = 9571
# text = WELL 6 WEEKS LATER WHEN HE CAME BACK OUT HE WAS AGAIN WORKING ON MY MARES FRONT FOOT AND I LOOKED DOWN AND YEAH HE HAD WHOLES IN HIS PANTS IN THE WRONG PLACES I BUST OUT LAUGHING AND HE WAS LIKE WHAT

# sent_id = 9572
# text = I WAS LIKE UMMMM I CAN SEE YOUR ASS CHEEKS HE WAS LIKE OOPS DID I FORGET MY UNDERWEAR

# sent_id = 9573
# text = THAT WAS A STRANGE WAY TO FLIRT BUT I GUSS IT WAS HIS WAY

# sent_id = 9574
# text = BUT LIKE I SAID NOTHING EVER CAME OF IT THE NEXT TIME I SAW HIM HE HAD TOLD ME HE HAD TO GET MARRIED TO A GIRL WHO HE WORKED WITH BECUSE HE KNOCKED HER UP

# sent_id = 9575
# text = I WAS HEARTBROKEN BUT THEN REALIZED HE WAS NOT THE GUY FOR ME

# sent_id = 9576
# text = WOW HE DOES SOUND INTERESTED IN YOU MY FARRIER NEVER GIVES ME HUGS LIKE THAT PROBABLY A GOOD THING AS HE HAS A WIFE AND 2 KIDS ANYWAY I FIND THAT THEY CAN BE VERY BUSY SO I WOULD WAIT A WEEK LO9NGER AND IF STILL NO REPLY GIVE HIM A CALL BUT DON T LEAVE A MESSAGE SO YOU DON T HAVE TO NECESSARILY WAIT FOR HIM TO CALL

# sent_id = 9577
# text = FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A BUSINESS AND CLIENT/OPERATOR RELATIONSHIPS HE'S DOING A REALLY SHITTY JOB

# sent_id = 9578
# text = LEAVING NAILS OUT SO YOU'LL CALL AND HAVE HIM COME BACK OUT LATER

# sent_id = 9579
# text = CUTE OR NOT I'D CALL A DIFFERENT BLOKE BECAUSE HE'S DOING A SUB-PAR JOB AT SOMETHING HE NEEDS TO BE DOING HIS BEST AT WHETHER HE'S FLIRTING OR TRYING TO ASK YOU OUT OR NOT HE OUGHT TO PUT QUALITY FIRST

# sent_id = 9580
# text = THIS IS AFTER ALL HIS BUSINESS AND IF HE WANTS YOU TO REMAIN A CUSTOMER WHY ON EARTH IS HE DOING SHODDY WORK

# sent_id = 9581
# text = EPM ANYONE DEALT WITH IT

# sent_id = 9582
# text = MIGHT BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT

# sent_id = 9583
# text = I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PICK UP A SUPER NICE 6 YEAR OLD FOR FREE

# sent_id = 9584
# text = HE'S NOT LAME BUT HE'S BEEN HAVING ISSUES

# sent_id = 9585
# text = HERE'S WHAT THE OWNER HAS SAID

# sent_id = 9586
# text = I HAVE A 5 YEAR OLD THAT LOST ALL OF HIS CHEEK MUSCLE ON THE RIGHT SIDE ABOUT 3-4 MONTHS AGO

# sent_id = 9587
# text = I CHALKED IT UP TO POSSIBLE NERVE DAMAGE BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT THE VET THOUGHT AND THE OTHER CHEEK MUSCLE WAS FINE AND HE HAD NO THEETH PROBLEMS

# sent_id = 9588
# text = SO I SENT HIM TO THE TRAINERS THE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER TO BE STARTED ON THE BARRELS

# sent_id = 9589
# text = I GOT HIM BACK THE FIRST OF THE MONTH AND HE HAD LOST SOME WEIGHT BUT ATTRIBUTED THAT TO BE WORKED EVERYDAY I EXPECTED HIM TO DROP SOME

# sent_id = 9590
# text = HE IS NOW LOSING THE CHEEK MUSCLE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF HIS FACE AND SEEMS TO BE DROPPING WEIGHT BY THE DAY

# sent_id = 9591
# text = HAD HIM TO A DENTIST YESTERDAY AND THERE IS NO TEETH PROBLEMS

# sent_id = 9592
# text = HE CAN EAT ALL HIS FEED AND DOESN'T DROP ANY BUT CANNOT EAT HAY FROM LACK OF MUSCLE TO CHEW IT

# sent_id = 9593
# text = HE IS GANT LOOKING IN HIS FLANK AREA AND IS LOSING TOPLINE MUSCLE

# sent_id = 9594
# text = THE ONLY NEUROLOGICAL SIGN THAT HE SHOWS IS THAT HE BARELY DRAGS HIS TOES AND SOMETIMES HAS TROUBLE WITH HIS RIGHT LEAD

# sent_id = 9595
# text = THE HORSE I HAD POSTED ABOUT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WITH THE ATROPHIED CHEEK MUSCLES IS DOWN TO HIS LAST RESORT FOR LIFE

# sent_id = 9596
# text = I CANNOT AFFORD TO TREAT WHATEVER IS WRONG WITH HIM

# sent_id = 9597
# text = NO I HAVE NOT DONE AN EPM TEST BUT HAVE DONE AN EXTENSIVE BLOOD PANEL AND MY VET DID A NEUROLOGICAL PHYSICAL EXAM

# sent_id = 9598
# text = WE ELECTED TO NOT DO THE EPM TEST BECAUSE THERE WAS NO NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS

# sent_id = 9599
# text = HE IS STILL SHOWING NO SIGNS OTHER THAN THE WEIGHT LOSS AND SOME MUSCLE ATROPHY

# sent_id = 9600
# text = HE EATS ALL OF HIS GRAIN BUT IT JUST TAKES HIM A WHILE TO GET IT CHEWED BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF MUSCLE IN HIS JAWS

# sent_id = 9601
# text = SO I MIGHT GET THE HORSE AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO

# sent_id = 9602
# text = I WILL BE GETTING WITH MY VET FIRST AND IF I DO GET HIM HAVE THE SPINAL FLUID TEST DONE FOR EPM AND A TITER TEST

# sent_id = 9603
# text = WILL BE GETTING A COPY OF THE BLOOD RESULTS THE OWNER HAS ALREADY RAN AS WELL

# sent_id = 9604
# text = MY OTHER THEORY WOULD BE WOBBLERS

# sent_id = 9605
# text = I'LL BE HAVING MY EQUINE CHIRO/ACUPUNCTURIST OUT TO DO SOME WORK AS WELL IF I DO GET HIM

# sent_id = 9606
# text = SO ANY IDEAS

# sent_id = 9607
# text = THINK I SHOULD DO IT

# sent_id = 9608
# text = ARBY

# sent_id = 9609
# text = HORSE IS OUT OF STATE AND NOT LOCAL

# sent_id = 9610
# text = I WILL BE CALLING MY VET AND CHIRO ABOUT HIM

# sent_id = 9611
# text = HE'S STILL RIDEABLE CURRENTLY AND NOT HAVING MANY ISSUES UNDER SADDLE

# sent_id = 9612
# text = THIS IS A HORSE THAT I OTHERWISE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD AND EVEN IF I SPEND 2K AND TREATMENT I COME OUT AHEAD OF HIS PURCHASE PRICE

# sent_id = 9613
# text = I POSTED WHAT THE OWNER AS SAID IN PARAGRAPH 2 & 3 THAT IS NOT ME TO CLARIFY

# sent_id = 9614
# text = SHE IS THE ONE THAT CAN'T AFFORD TO DO ANYTHING ELSE FOR HIM IN CASE HE DOESN'T RECOVER FULLY

# sent_id = 9615
# text = HE CAN EAT GRAIN AND I ALREADY HAVE A FEED REGIMEN IN MY HEAD FOR THE GUY SINCE HE CAN'T EAT REGULAR HAY

# sent_id = 9616
# text = I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE HARD TO KEEP HIS WEIGHT UP SO LONG AS HE CAN EAT THE GRAIN

# sent_id = 9617
# text = I AM NOT GOING TO GO PICK UP A HORSE I CAN'T AFFORD

# sent_id = 9618
# text = I AM WILLING TO PULL THE EPM TEST AND TREAT

# sent_id = 9619
# text = THE OWNER IS THE ONE WHO IS UNABLE

# sent_id = 9620
# text = I WILL ALSO BE HAVING MY OTHER VET UP WHO'S A CHIRO & ACUPUNCTURIST TO EVALUATE HIM FOR WOBBLERS

# sent_id = 9621
# text = JULY IS WHEN HE STARTED TO EXHIBIT SLIGHT SYMPTOMS AND THE OWNER AND VET ORIGINALLY THOUGHT IT WAS JUST SOME NERVE DAMAGE FROM SOMETHING IN THE PASTURE WITH NO VISIBLE INJURY

# sent_id = 9622
# text = HE'S ONLY EXHIBITED WEIGHT LOSS AND SOME MUSCLE ATROPHY WITH THE SLIGHT TOE DRAG AND A BIT OF TROUBLE WITH THE RIGHT LEAD WHICH COULD OR COULDN'T BE RELATED

# sent_id = 9623
# text = THE HORSE IS NOT IN PAIN

# sent_id = 9624
# text = HE'S NOT STARVING

# sent_id = 9625
# text = HE'S DROPPING WE

# sent_id = 9626
# text = THE HORSE IS NOT IN PAIN

# sent_id = 9627
# text = HE'S NOT STARVING

# sent_id = 9628
# text = HE'S DROPPING WEIGHT BUT MOST OF THAT CAME FROM BEING AT THE TRAINERS AND BEING RIDDEN HARD FOR 60 DAYS

# sent_id = 9629
# text = HE'S NOT PUTTING IT BACK ON

# sent_id = 9630
# text = I KNOW THAT I HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF TREATING HIM AND STILL HAVING TO PUT HIM DOWN

# sent_id = 9631
# text = AT THE SAME TIME I DO KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD HORSES COME BACK SUCCESSFULLY AFTER EPM

# sent_id = 9632
# text = I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE

# sent_id = 9633
# text = I'M WILLING TO GIVE IT A SHOT

# sent_id = 9634
# text = GALLOP I'VE ALREADY READ THAT WHOLE SITE AND BEEN READING THROUGH RESEARCH ARTICLES FROM THE RESEARCH COLLEGES AS WELL

# sent_id = 9635
# text = LOOKED AT STUDIES TREATMENT OPTIONS AND SUCH

# sent_id = 9636
# text = I WILL HAVE THE EPM TEST DONE BEFORE TREATING

# sent_id = 9637
# text = THE CHIRO/ACUPUNCTURIST WILL BE THERE TO EVALUATE THE HORSE FOR WOBBLERS WHICH IS OFTEN CAUSED BY SPINAL COMPRESSION AND CAN BE CONFUSED WITH EPM

# sent_id = 9638
# text = IF THAT IS THE CASE THEN ACUPUNCTURE ISN'T GOING TO HURT HIM

# sent_id = 9639
# text = IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR EPM

# sent_id = 9640
# text = I THINK IT IS WONDERFULLY RESPONSIBLE THAT YOU ARE GOING INTO THIS RESCUE EYES OPEN AND ARE GETTING THE OPINIONS OF QUALIFIED PROFESSIONALS AND A BUNCH OF YAHOOS BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO TAKE THIS HORSE ON

# sent_id = 9641
# text = I DO THINK SOME Y A USERS NEED TO WORK ON THEIR READING COMPREHENSION AS I CAN'T COMPREHEND HOW TAKING A HORSE IN AS A RESCUE AND GETTING IT QUALIFIED MEDICAL TREATMENT IS ABUSE

# sent_id = 9642
# text = WORST CASE SCENARIO YOU FALL IN LOVE AND AFTER SPENDING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS YOU HAVE TO PUT THE HORSE DOWN

# sent_id = 9643
# text = IS THAT SOMETHING YOU ARE UP FOR

# sent_id = 9644
# text = IF SO GO FOR IT AND I'LL GIVE YOU ALL THE MORAL SUPPORT I CAN AS YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT IS UP

# sent_id = 9645
# text = IT IS HEARTBREAKING TO TRY TO BRING A HORSE BACK AND THEN HAVE TO PUT IT DOWN BUT SOME HORSES ARE WORTH THE RISK

# sent_id = 9646
# text = IF YOU FEEL THIS GUY IS WORTH IT THEN I HOPE YOUR VET CAN FIGURE THINGS OUT

# sent_id = 9647
# text = AS TO EPM LIKE SHEE SAID BEING IN MI WE'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH IT

# sent_id = 9648
# text = PRETTY MUCH EVERY LARGE STABLE HAS HERE

# sent_id = 9649
# text = OUR FIRST DIAGNOSED EPM HORSE WAS BACK WHEN THERE WAS NO TREATMENT IN THE US AND ONLY AN EXPERIMENTAL CHICKEN FEED ADDITIVE IN CANADA

# sent_id = 9650
# text = WE HAULED THE HORSE TO WINDSOR AND GOT HIM TREATED THERE

# sent_id = 9651
# text = THAT HORSE RETURNED TO RACING AND WE DIDN'T NOTICE MUCH DIFFERENCE

# sent_id = 9652
# text = WE'VE HAD A FEW SINCE THEN BUT NONE SINCE OUR RACE HORSES BEGAN WINTERING IN FLORIDA

# sent_id = 9653
# text = I HAVE NO IDEA IF THAT IS RELATED OR FARMERS ARE DOING A BETTER JOB OF CLEARING OUT OPOSSUMS NOW BECAUSE THEY KNOW OPOSSUMS ARE CARRIERS BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD AN EPM HORSE IN AT LEAST 10 YEARS

# sent_id = 9654
# text = I CAN SAY ALL OF OUR EPM HORSES WERE TREATED EARLY WHEN THEY WERE SHOWING MILD SIGNS LIKE SHEE GAVE AND ALL RETURNED TO RACING

# sent_id = 9655
# text = ONE HORSE EVEN GOT HIS LIFETIME MARK AFTER BEING TREATED FOR EPM

# sent_id = 9656
# text = WE'VE ALWAYS LIKED BIG LONG TROTTERS THAT DO BETTER ON MILE TRACKS THEN 1/2 MILE

# sent_id = 9657
# text = THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WE NOTICED IS THAT THE EPM HORSES SEEMED TO DO WORSE ON THE SMALLER TRACKS AFTER

# sent_id = 9658
# text = IT MIGHT JUST BE COINCIDENCE OR THE FACT THOSE GREAT BIG TROTTERS WITH THOSE EXTREMELY LONG BACKS LOST A BIT OF FINE COORDINATION TO GET THOSE GANGLY BODIES AROUND THOSE TIGHTER TURNS

# sent_id = 9659
# text = I DON'T KNOW

# sent_id = 9660
# text = MSU DOES A LOT OF EPM STUDIES BECAUSE OF HOW COMMON IT IS HERE

# sent_id = 9661
# text = YOU MAY WANT TO SEE IF YOU CAN GET IN TOUCH WITH THEIR EPM GROUP AND GET THIS GUY IN A STUDY

# sent_id = 9662
# text = I KNOW THEY DID LAB WORK SHOWING THAT STRONGID C USED DAILY COULD HELP PREVENT EPM

# sent_id = 9663
# text = I BELIEVE THEY HAVE A REAL STUDY TESTING THE LAB WORK IN REAL WORLD SITUATIONS NOW BUT IT MAY BE SOMETIME BEFORE THOSE RESULTS ARE RELEASED

# sent_id = 9664
# text = ANOTHER THOUGHT WITH THIS BEING A MOSQUITO SEASON FROM HELL COULD IT BE WEST NILE

# sent_id = 9665
# text = WEST NILE CAN CAUSE EPM LIKE SYMPTOMS AND DOESN'T ALWAYS INCLUDE A FEVER

# sent_id = 9666
# text = LET US KNOW WHAT YOU DECIDE TO DO

# sent_id = 9667
# text = YOU HATE TO SEE TALENT GET WASTED BUT HONESTLY I DON'T THINK I COULD TAKE IN A HORSE RIGHT NOW THESE ISSUES

# sent_id = 9668
# text = PERSONALLY I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST KEEP ON WALKING BY

# sent_id = 9669
# text = YOU SHOULD HAVE YOU CHIRO OUT BEFORE YOU DECIDE IF YOU WANT THIS HORSE OR NOT

# sent_id = 9670
# text = IF YOU HAVE A GOOD REPOIRE WHICH I'M SURE YOU DO WITH THEM THEY SHOULD BE HONEST ON IF THIS HORSE IS FIXABLE TO ANY DEGREE NOT REALLY SURE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH HIM

# sent_id = 9671
# text = EVEN IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS POOR PONEH THERE IS ALWAYS THE CHANCE FOR REMISSION AND THEN RELAPSE SO YOU MAY HAVE TO DO DEAL WITH AGAIN IN THE FUTURE

# sent_id = 9672
# text = SO ALL IN ALL PUT THE MONEY UP FRONT BEFORE TAKING ON THIS HORSE

# sent_id = 9673
# text = A FEW HUNDRED OUT OF POCKET NOW WILL POSSIBLY SAVE YOU THOUSANDS ONCE THE HORSE IS IN YOUR NAME

# sent_id = 9674
# text = COULD HE HAVE HAD A BLOW TO THE HEAD CAUSING THIS ATROPHY

# sent_id = 9675
# text = OR A DIFFICULT BIRTH

# sent_id = 9676
# text = WAS IT ALWAYS LIKE THIS

# sent_id = 9677
# text = OR HAS IT OCCURRED SINCE BIRTH

# sent_id = 9678
# text = I ALSO WONDER IF HE MIGHT HAVE HAD A SLIGHT STROKE

# sent_id = 9679
# text = I THINK IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO GET HIM TREATED THAT YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER HIM AS A PROSPECT

# sent_id = 9680
# text = WHO KNOWS WHAT THE FUTURE MIGHT HOLD AND IT MIGHT BE EXPENSIVE

# sent_id = 9681
# text = EXTREMELY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE

# sent_id = 9682

# text = TWO MONTHS AND AT LEAST TWO MONTHS ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT THINGS

# sent_id = 12201

# text = THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN FOR ANY RESTAURANT LIKE ZAHAV IS TO HAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE WRITE HYPERBOLIC REVIEWS MAKING CLAIMS THAT EVERYONE IS GOING TO LOVE THE FOOD DECOR AND SERVICE

# sent_id = 12304
# text = THE TRUTH IS IN MY AND MY DINING PARTNERS' EXPERIENCE THIS IS A FINE LITTLE RESTAURANT WITH SOME UNIQUE FOOD

# sent_id = 12305

# sent_id = 12320
# text = PERHAPS HAD WE NOT GONE INTO THIS RESTAURANT BELIEVING ZAHAV WAS GOING TO BE GOLDEN AS ITS NAME SUGGESTS AND AS THE MANY GOLDEN REVIEWS SEEM TO ATTEST WE WOULD HAVE ENJOYED A DECENT LITTLE EXPENSIVE EXPERIENCE

# sent_id = 12350
# text = I WAITED ABOUT 20 MINUTES IN THE STORE PART BEFORE ANYONE WAS ABLE TO ASSIST ME AND WAS THEN TOLD TO PULL MY CAR INTO THE SHOP THAT IS APPARENTLY WHAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO BUT THE BIG SIGNS POINTING YOU THAT WAY ARE FOR SOME REASON KEPT INSIDE THE GARAGE SO YOU DON'T SEE THEM DRVING UP AND THEY PURPOSELY BLOCK THE FRONT PULL-UP THAT ALL OTHER SEAR'S USE

# sent_id = 12351
# text = ONCE INSIDE I HAD TO STAND AROUND FOR AT LEAST 10 MORE MINUTES BEFORE FINALLY-- A TECHNICIAN GOT TO ME

# sent_id = 12352

# sent_id = 12360
# text = HE SAID IT WAS THE SAME TIRE AND VERIFIED THIS AFTER CHECKING BOTH THE ACTUAL TIRE ON MY CAR AND MY SERVICE PAPERS FROM EARLIER IN THE WEEK

# sent_id = 12361
# text = HOWEVER WHEN HE PRINTED OUT THE SERVICE QUOTE I COULD SEE THAT IT WAS NOT THE CORRECT TIRE AND WAS NOT EVEN AN APPROPRIATE TIRE FOR MY CAR MODEL

# sent_id = 12362
# text = SO I POINTED THIS OUT TO HIM AT WHICH POINT HE SAID THEY ONLY HAD ONE OF THE CORRECT TIRES IN STOCK

# sent_id = 12363
# text = OK FINE

# sent_id = 12364
# text = SO I GOT JUST MY OTHER REAR TIRE REPLACED
