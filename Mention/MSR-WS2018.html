Welcome to the first Workshop on multilingual Surface
Realization! i.e., on mapping unordered
and uninflected universal dependency trees to
correctly ordered and inflected sentences in a
number of languages. A second deeper input
will be available in which, in addition,
functional words, fine-grained PoS and morphological
information will be removed from
the input trees. The first shared task on Surface
Realization was carried out in 2011 with
a similar setup, with a focus on English. We
think that it is time for relaunching such a
shared task effort in view of the arrival of Universal
Dependencies annotated treebanks for
a large number of languages on the one hand,
and the increasing dominance of Deep Learning,
which proved to be a game changer for
NLP, on the other hand.
		   <ul>
		   <li> representative predicate-argument extraction paradigms, namely Combinatory Categorical Grammar (CCG) and Dependency Grammar (DG), elaborating on corresponding implications regarding the expressiveness and completeness of the subsequently generated linked data; </li>
		   <li> linguistic resources, the main focus being on FrameNet, as backbone for delineating meaning in the extracted predicates and their participating arguments; </li>
		   <li> presentation of state-of-the-art frame detection systems in order to illustrate and foster understanding of the strengths and weaknesses incurred by the different predicate-arguments paradigms; </li>
		   <li> vocabularies and models for generating Linked Data and ontologies.</li>
		   </ul> -->
		   
            <p></p>

The first workshop on multilingual surface realization aims at bringing 
together people who are interested in surface-oriented Natural Language 
Generation problems such as word order determination, inflection, 
functional
word determination, paraphrasing, etc. It will accomodate for the 
presentation of the results of the Surface Realization Shared Task 2018 
and of a number of technichal papers on the topic.
 <br> <br>
The workshop will be held at <a href="http://acl2018.org/">ACL'18</a> in Melbourne, Australia, on July 19th 2018.

            <!--Overview            -->
            <h3 id="description">Call for papers</h3>

            <p>
Natural Language Generation (NLG) is in the ascendant both as a 
stand-alone data-to-text or text-to-text task and as part of downstream 
applications (see, e.g., abstractive summarization, dialogue-based 
interaction, question answering, etc.).
Only in 2017, three “deep” NLG shared tasks that focused on language 
generation from
abstract semantic representations have been organized (although for 
English only):
<a href="http://webnlg.loria.fr/pages/challenge.html">WebNLG</a>, <a href="http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task9/">SemEval Task 9</a>
, <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/InteractionLab/E2E/">E2E</a>.
However, when compared to, e.g., parsing or
machine translation, NLG still lags behind in terms of theoretical 
advances. Thus, while recent years witnessed a shift of the processing 
paradigm in these areas from traditional supervised machine learning 
techniques to deep learning techniques, NLG did not arrive there fully 
yet.
 
 Similarly, NLG still does not make full use of the available resources 
in the way, e.g., parsing does. For instance, the multilingual <a href="http://universaldependencies.org/">Universal Dependencies (UD)</a> dataset has already been used for the <a href="http://universaldependencies.org/conll17/">CoNLL'17 parsing shared task</a>.
 This dataset, which currently consists of 102 treebanks covering about 
60 languages and can be downloaded freely, facilitates the development 
of large scale applications that work potentially across all of the UD 
treebank languages in a uniform fashion.
 
 <br> <br>
MSR-WS aims to change the situation and put NLG, and, in particular, 
surface generation, onto the main stream research agenda of 
Computational Linguistics, bringing together communities that hardly 
collaborated so far. It will provide a forum for the presentation of the
 results of the currently open multilingual Surface Realization Shared 
Task 2018 (SR’18) and of high quality papers on surface realization and 
related topics. SR’18 focuses on multilingual surface generation 
starting from UD treebanks. Since UDs are structures with a degree of 
abstraction that is targeted by state-of- the-art parsing, such that 
that the challenge to reverse neural network parsing algorithms for 
generation becomes a plausible research question, SR’18 solicits, apart 
from genuine generation approaches, contributions by the parsing 
community.
SR’18 also aims to attract participants from other areas such as 
Computer Assisted Language Learning (and, in particular, grammatical 
error correction, since one of the tracks of the SR’18 is the generation
 of functional words such as bound prepositions and auxiliaries, whose 
correct introduction/omission is one of the primary challenges for 
language learners).
 <br> <br>
To complement the presentation of the SR’18 results, MSR-WS solicits 
contributions on all topics that are related to surface realization in 
NLG. Sought are presentations of cutting edge approaches that address 
problems of surface-oriented generation such as grammatical and/or 
information structure-driven word order determination, inflection, 
functional word determination, paraphrasing, etc. The presented works 
are expected to be a clear contribution to the progress in robust 
multilingual surface generation, i.e., be language-independent or easily
 portable from one language to another and clearly scalable. The topics 
of interest include, but are not limited to:
		   </p><ul>
				<li> Linearization in NLG </li>
				<li> Multilingual approaches to surface realization </li>
				<li> Function word generation </li>
				<li> Inflection in NLG </li>
				<li> Joint generation from abstract representations </li>
				<li> Surface-oriented text simplification </li>
				<li> Surface-oriented spoken language generation </li>
				<li> Application of surface realization for grammatical error correction </li>
				<li> NLG in surface-oriented paraphrasing </li>
				<li> Deep learning approaches to NLG </li>
		   </ul>

            Recent years have witnessed an increasingly closer interaction between the Semantic Web (SW) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) communities.
            This has fostered, among others, the deployment of NLP tools and resources for detecting linguistic predicate-argument structures in the extraction of rich text
            conceptualizations that explicitly cater for n-ary relations. Such tools include so-called shallow-semantic parsers, which are capable of identifying linguistic predicates and their
            arguments, and semantic role labellers, which assign semantic types to predicate-argument structures. In parallel, lexical resources that provide specifications of predicates in term of
            their arguments have been made available. While some of these resources focus on the syntactic realization of verb senses (e.g.
            <a href="https://verbs.colorado.edu/~mpalmer/projects/ace.html">PropBank</a>), others go beyond and provide an inventory of predicative meanings with a fully semantic specification of their arguments
			(e.g. <a href="https://verbs.colorado.edu/~mpalmer/projects/verbnet.html">VerbNet</a> and <a href="https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/home">FrameNet</a>). These form convenient starting points for publishing text contents as Linked Data and for producing ontologies, without the need for a-priori schemas.
			<br><br>
	    Given the saliency of n-ary relation extraction from text and the relatively recent advances, the objective of this tutorial is to familiarize participants with the tools and resources
	    involved in the extraction of such relations from text as a means for populating the Semantic Web. Thus, it considers three intertwined key topics, namely predicate-argument extraction,
	    semantic typing of extracted predicate-arguments, and models for generating ontologies and Linked Data representations.
		<br><br>
	    More specifically, in this tutorial we will first introduce participants to two main paradigms of predicate-argument extraction, namely Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG)
	    and Dependency Grammar (DG), discuss the respective pros and cons, and outline the implications that the two paradigms entail for the extracted predicate-argument structures.
	    Examples of the latter include the handling linguistic phenomena such as lexical and functional prepositions, copulas, and so forth. Complementary to the background material,
	    state-of-the art tools, namely <a href="http://svn.ask.it.usyd.edu.au/trac/candc/wiki/boxer">Boxer</a> and
	    the  <a href="https://github.com/talnsoftware">TALN-UPF transducers </a> that implement a CCG- and shallow
	    semantic parsing, will be used for illustration and practical experimentation.
Secondly, we will go through related lexical and linguistic resources, deployed for the semantic typing of predicate-arguments, including PropBank, VerbNet and FrameNet. Alongside,
representative state-of-the-art tools will be presented including <a href="http://demo.ark.cs.cmu.edu/parse">Semafor</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/talnsoftware/FrameSemantics_parser">the TALN-UPF frame semantic parser</a>, <a href="http://wit.istc.cnr.it/stlab-tools/fred">FRED</a> and <a href="https://knowledgestore2.fbk.eu/pikes-demo/">PIKES</a>.
Special focus will be placed on elaborating, on the repercussions that their different predicate-argument extraction methodologies have with respect to their performances.
