# text = Hello.

# sent_id = email-enronsent27_01-0003
# text = I was originally inquiring about purchasing a Cross or Signac impressionist lithograph.

# sent_id = email-enronsent27_01-0004
# text = I found them and purchased both from a gallery in London, William Weston.

# sent_id = email-enronsent27_01-0005
# text = They should be delivered this week.

# sent_id = email-enronsent27_01-0006

# text = By the way the Lichtenstein is up and hanging in our formal living room and it is magnificent.

# sent_id = email-enronsent27_01-0008

# sent_id = email-enronsent27_01-0009

# sent_id = email-enronsent27_01-0010
# text = Actually, a lot.

# sent_id = email-enronsent27_01-0011
# text = I will be looking for one or more of the following.

# sent_id = email-enronsent27_01-0012
# text = My concept is that overtime I would like to own one of all the following artists and they are all depending when I find something that we really like.

# sent_id = email-enronsent27_01-0013
# text = I listed all of our (sometimes mine vs. my wife's favorites and priorities).

# sent_id = email-enronsent27_01-0014
# text = They are kind of in rank order but as I stated if I find the piece that I like we will purchase it.

# sent_id = email-enronsent27_01-0015
# text = I want signed and numbered.

# sent_id = email-enronsent27_01-0016
# text = I realize that some were not signed by the artist but it is an important fact in my buying decision.

# sent_id = email-enronsent27_01-0017
# text = I also realize that some may not have done any works on paper or they are outrageously expensive.

# sent_id = email-enronsent27_01-0018
# text = For example, I would like to know if Rothko or Kline did any work on paper.

# sent_id = email-enronsent27_01-0019
# text = At least that is what I am thinking now.

# sent_id = email-enronsent27_01-0020
# text = Bonnard (colorful only)

# text = By the way, I am interested in re-looking at a Picasso (although we have 2) that your gallery had a couple of years ago.

# sent_id = email-enronsent27_01-0034
# text = It was a cubist piece from the 1920s and I believe you called the technique a "push wa" (pronunciation Vs an attempt at the proper spelling).

# sent_id = email-enronsent27_01-0035
# text = It was for sale in a couple of galleries in SF and was about $20,000.

# sent_id = email-enronsent27_01-0036
# text = Is there 1 available?

# sent_id = email-enronsent27_01-0037
# text = Also I am still thinking about the Matisse we discussed before but as you can see, I have a lot of other artists I am interested in and it may remain on the back burner because we already have one.

# text = I have a couple of questions so I can wrap up the LOI:

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0023
# text = We refer to licensed Fuel Cell Energy equipment.

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0024
# text = Do we intend to reference a particular manufacturer, or should this be more generic?

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0025
# text = Do we want to attach a draft of the Development Agreement, and condition the final deal on agreeing to terms substantially the same as what's in the draft?

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0026
# text = I have a concern that the Enron optionality bug could bite us on the backside with that one.

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0027
# text = Do we expect to have ONE EPC contract, or several?

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0028
# text = I'm looking for the confidentiality agreement, which may be in Bart's files (haven't checked closely yet).

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0029

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0032
# text = Forget the ONE or more contract questions.

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0033
# text = I see we expect to have separate contracts for each project.

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0034
# text = I have a couple of questions so I can wrap up the LOI:

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0035

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0043
# text = Kay

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0044
# text = On the issue of the contracts, the draft says that the $170m is paid when the EPC contract is signed.

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0045
# text = Are we expecting that the portion attributable to each project will be paid as the individual EPC contracts are signed?

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0046
# text = Thanks,

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0047
# text = Kay

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0048
# text = 1. The pricing that we have given CRRA is specific to FuelCell Energy and would not be meaningful without listing the manufacturer (i.e., ONSI would be a lot more money).

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0049
# text = Hence, I think that we have to reference the manufacturer.

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0050
# text = 2. The attachment of the Development Agreement is a Jeff question.

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0051
# text = In order to mark any 2000 income, we will need to get CRRA to execute the Development Agreement in 2000.

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0052
# text = In my opinion, we should show CRRA a copy of the LOI with the assumption that the Development Agreement is attached.

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0053
# text = I would actually send them the draft Development Agreement a couple days after the LOI.

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0054
# text = Based on how CRRA reacts, I would make an ultimate determination if the agreement needs to be attached to the LOI.

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0055
# text = 3. I expect at least one EPC contract per project.

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0056
# text = We don't want to condition the acceptance of one project on the performance of another project.

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0057
# text = Performance tests will either be performed on a project basis or a unit by unit basis in a given project.

# sent_id = email-enronsent26_01-0058

# sent_id = email-enronsent01_02-0023
# text = I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough of a global message and the means of delivery.

# sent_id = email-enronsent01_02-0024
# text = On the means of delivery, I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent.

# sent_id = email-enronsent01_02-0026
# text = Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article?

# sent_id = email-enronsent01_02-0027
# text = With regard to a global message, I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities.

# sent_id = email-enronsent01_02-0028
# text = With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide.

# sent_id = email-enronsent01_02-0029
# text = These global standards also should enable Enron to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations.

# sent_id = email-enronsent01_02-0030
# text = I am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.

# sent_id = email-enronsent01_02-0031
# text = Finally, a question regarding timing.

# sent_id = email-enronsent01_02-0032
# text = The last I knew after you and Brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) for comments to all business controllers.

# sent_id = email-enronsent01_02-0033
# text = I don't believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.

# sent_id = email-enronsent01_02-0034
# text = And not to belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards.

# sent_id = email-enronsent01_02-0035
# text = My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year.

# sent_id = email-enronsent01_02-0036
# text = There is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.

# sent_id = email-enronsent01_02-0037
# text = Shona has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has already been working with James New.

# sent_id = email-enronsent01_02-0038
# text = So I question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against.

# sent_id = email-enronsent01_02-0039
# text = Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful exception report?

# sent_id = email-enronsent01_02-0040
# text = Sorry that this response looks so long.

# sent_id = email-enronsent01_02-0041
# text = I have been interrupted 20 times while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.

# sent_id = email-enronsent01_02-0042
# text = Thanks for sharing this with me.

# sent_id = email-enronsent01_02-0043

# sent_id = email-enronsent20_01-0004
# text = We have been able to keep ENA's direct group expenses flat year on year, we are trying hard to keep the corporate allocation flat year to year as well.

# sent_id = email-enronsent20_01-0010

# sent_id = email-enronsent20_01-0011
# text = In some respects I don't think the first panel could have gone much better; everyone thanked FERC for intervening (though for different reasons).

# sent_id = email-enronsent20_01-0034
# text = Steve:

# sent_id = email-enronsent20_01-0035
# text = At this point, our IT contacts are backpedalling a bit and suggesting they can overcome the TIBCO and Terminal Server problems.

# sent_id = email-enronsent20_01-0036
# text = There are still four important issues, however:

# sent_id = email-enronsent20_01-0037
# text = IT still cannot commit to transferring messages across domains.

# sent_id = email-enronsent20_01-0038
# text = This means that messages initiated at Corp and intended for the entire Enron organization will not reach any business units outside the Corp domain.

# sent_id = email-enronsent20_01-0039
# text = No messages will reach the EES organization unless IBM agrees not to use their proprietary message delivery tool, WebSphere, and will use WebLogic instead.

# sent_id = email-enronsent20_01-0040
# text = WebLogic is required by BackWeb, although it is designed by a separate company.

# sent_id = email-enronsent20_01-0041
# text = HR, intended to be a key user of this tool, will not use BackWeb because survey responses cannot be made anonymous.

# sent_id = email-enronsent20_01-0042
# text = HR has already purchased a tool called CONFIRMIT that can execute anonymous surveys.

# sent_id = email-enronsent20_01-0043
# text = Messages will not be delivered simultaneously to all users in the same domain, nor will they be delivered for two to five hours after they are sent by the message administrator.

# sent_id = email-enronsent20_01-0044
# text = Another thing to consider is that these messages will be set to expire and disappear within a set period of time, meaning users cannot retrieve them and read them later (as they can with e-mail).

# sent_id = email-enronsent20_01-0045
# text = This means that I could be away from the office for several days and miss a message entirely, because it would have expired and disappeared by the time I returned.

# sent_id = email-enronsent20_01-0046
# text = The plain fact is that a few members of IT are pushing this initiative, but they lack commercial sponsorship.

# sent_id = email-enronsent20_01-0047
# text = They are hoping Corp will foot the bill for a pilot which will allow them to fully test this tool before implementing it company-wide.

# sent_id = email-enronsent06_01-0088
# text = Topic for panel, "PUC Priorities."

# sent_id = email-enronsent06_01-0089
# text = Goal is to (politely?) refute Loretta Lynch's and Carl Woods' continued assertions that 1) California's move to deregulate was based solely on ideology with no basis in fact and 2) the solution is to turn back the clock to command-and-control regulation.

# sent_id = email-enronsent06_01-0090

# text = Marly asked me to respond to you.

# sent_id = email-enronsent16_01-0006
# text = As you know, the suffix ONLINE is purely descriptive and now used by many companies.

# sent_id = email-enronsent16_01-0007
# text = Therefore, any trade mark registration that incorporates the word ONLINE as a suffix in the way that you use it will not enable its owner to prevent others from using the word ONLINE.

# sent_id = email-enronsent16_01-0008
# text = Given the above, if you have adequate protection for the word ENRON (which covers the services that you offer on-line as well as your core activities), I'd say that another application for the words ENRON ONLINE is probably unnecessary.

# sent_id = email-enronsent16_01-0009
# text = However, if you use a particular logo for the on-line service, that should be registered.

# sent_id = email-enronsent16_01-0010

# text = Thanks.

# sent_id = email-enronsent16_01-0020
# text = I believe we are to some extent already protected with "Enron" proceeded with anything, but EnronOnline(TM) , etc. just affords us more protection.

# sent_id = email-enronsent16_01-0021
# text = I assume this is akin to why McDonald's trademarks "Mc"Everything?

# sent_id = email-enronsent16_01-0060
# text = BC Gas won't sign the confirms with the rep in, and this has caused much difficulties.

# sent_id = email-enronsent16_01-0061

# sent_id = email-enronsent02_01-0011
# text = Despite the best efforts of IT, continuing problems with the AS400 application, a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock reconciliation reports, and concerns over the useability of the outright stock screen enquiry are such that I am currently not confident of delivering sufficient accurate information to AA to satisfy their audit requirements - which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and forward positions to full accounting values.

# sent_id = email-enronsent02_01-0012
# text = Consequently I need to inform you of, and/or require your approval for, the following :

# sent_id = email-enronsent02_01-0014

# sent_id = email-enronsent02_01-0015

# text = User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements for the support of OBSF.

# text = Randy, this is the issue I left you the voice mail on.

# sent_id = email-enronsent10_01-0002
# text = Article 6 of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement (which I am sending to you separately) with ECS obligates ECS to "work in good faith with CDEC" to establish an automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading conditions on CDEC's system.

# sent_id = email-enronsent10_01-0003
# text = We had a pretty good idea when we signed the contract that ECS would not be able to complete that by the contract start date, so we negotiated a fall back plan under which ECS is obligated to "assist [Transwestern] in developing a manual system to accomplish the same result and will hold harmless and keep [Transwestern] whole for all cost and expenses" associated with the manual system.

# sent_id = email-enronsent10_01-0004
# text = We will fight with them about who owes the $200k that James mentions below based on their failure to "assist" us in managing the cost.

# sent_id = email-enronsent10_01-0005
# text = In the mean time, we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to mitigate future costs.

# sent_id = email-enronsent10_01-0006
# text = Do we have someone who is watching this out there?

# sent_id = email-enronsent10_01-0007
# text = We are running so full tilt on TW that we may not have as much flexibiltiy to manage this situation as we expected, but let me know what we can do.

# sent_id = email-enronsent10_01-0008
# text = James had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement--I guess between ECS and Transwestern--that would permit ECS to communicate to us the details on how to access teh key info. from CDEC.

# sent_id = email-enronsent10_01-0009
# text = That sounds like a BS excuse from ECS, but it that's what they are saying, let me know and we can figure out a solution.

# sent_id = email-enronsent10_01-0010

# sent_id = email-enronsent10_01-0015
# text = My understanding was that ECS was to provide a means to access CDEC's online profile in order for us to make a decision to avoid running the compressor during CDEC's peak load periods.

# sent_id = email-enronsent10_01-0016
# text = We have not received access to this information which has resulted so far in additional electric cost of $200,987.33 for the period of July through September.

# sent_id = email-enronsent10_01-0017
# text = Additional cost will be incurred for the remainder of this year, that I have not been able to review yet.

# sent_id = email-enronsent10_01-0018
# text = This cost is averaging $79,000 per month if we continue to run the compressor as we have in August and September.

# sent_id = email-enronsent10_01-0019
# text = Good point, but I'm comfortable we're covered because our bidders were all bidding on a chunk of capacity and primary points.

# sent_id = email-enronsent10_01-0020
# text = They are deemed to be on notice that they had alternate point rights (its in the tariff) and if they wanted to submit a bid that had a different rate for primaries and alternates, they could have done so.

# sent_id = email-enronsent10_01-0021
# text = None of them did, and most importantly, the winning bidders did not.

# sent_id = email-enronsent10_01-0022
# text = Our letter agreement simply memorializes that we will charge the same negotiated rate whether the gas flows on primaries or alternates.

# sent_id = email-enronsent10_01-0023
# text = I assume from your message you are OK with this and they can get it nailed down?

# sent_id = email-enronsent10_01-0024
# text = DF

# sent_id = email-enronsent10_01-0025

# text = If Sam's description below of the GCP procedure is correct, it looks to me like something needs to be changed.

# sent_id = email-enronsent41_01-0070
# text = The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from Global Counterparty.

# sent_id = email-enronsent41_01-0071
# text = Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names.

# sent_id = email-enronsent41_01-0072
# text = If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself.

# sent_id = email-enronsent41_01-0073
# text = That is the source of Tana's concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system.

# sent_id = email-enronsent41_01-0074
# text = My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed.

# sent_id = email-enronsent41_01-0075
# text = In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining.

# sent_id = email-enronsent05_02-0018

# sent_id = email-enronsent05_02-0021

# sent_id = email-enronsent05_02-0022

# sent_id = email-enronsent05_02-0023

# text = OBSERVATION--The pressure to finger somebody for "price gouging" is increasing.

# sent_id = email-enronsent05_02-0078
# text = The administration is hell bent on finding a "fall guy."

# sent_id = email-enronsent05_02-0079
# text = The price spikes pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out.

# sent_id = email-enronsent05_02-0080

# sent_id = email-enronsent05_02-0081
# text = On my panel, Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers.

# sent_id = email-enronsent05_02-0085
# text = The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a "real" investigation, with hearings, testimony, data discovery---the works.

# sent_id = email-enronsent05_02-0086
# text = On the positive side, the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak, his analysis, and his remarks on the panel.

# sent_id = email-enronsent05_02-0087
# text = Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of California's market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit.

# sent_id = email-enronsent05_02-0088
# text = He also stated that just everyone's just acting in their own self-interest, responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure.

# sent_id = email-enronsent05_02-0089
# text = IMPLICATION--It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered.

# sent_id = email-enronsent05_02-0090
# text = In the best case, the clamoring for a "refund" subsides.

# sent_id = email-enronsent05_02-0091
# text = In which case, the only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the risks of getting fingered.

# sent_id = email-enronsent05_02-0092
# text = In the medium case, investigations find that Enron (like others) "played by the rules," but the rules stunk, and Enron profited at the expense of California consumers.

# sent_id = email-enronsent05_02-0093
# text = You're right, Sue.

# sent_id = email-enronsent05_02-0094
# text = Rates can't go up w/out declaring the rate freeze over in some fashion---trying to finesse it.

# sent_id = email-enronsent05_02-0095
# text = Thanks very much for the comments.

# sent_id = email-enronsent05_02-0096
# text = Harry also had a good comment---don't specify the amount of rate increase in our comments; rather note that the rate increase needs to be well-reasoned and based on facts and evidence.

# sent_id = email-enronsent05_02-0097

# text = Tom Byargeon, Kevin Miller and Ken Loch in ENA are working with producers in the US involved in deep water offshore Louisiana/Texas oil and gas drilling projects.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0036
# text = This financing activity was primarily started to help ENA secure long term well head and pipeline natural gas supplies to supplement the gas trading desk activities.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0037
# text = Just like what happened in Enron's initial VPP program they are find more interest in oil drilling projects rather than natural gas projects.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0038
# text = They are currently working on a bid (due 1/31) for the Medusa project which involves Murphy (operator), Agip and Callon in Mississippi Canyon Blocks #538 and #582.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0039
# text = The initial reservoir reports estimate reserves of 80-120 million barrels of sour crude and they estimate initial production to be 40,000 bpd starting in 1Q 2003.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0040
# text = Quality is estimated to be a Mars type crude with 25-27 API Gravity and 1.5-2.0% sulfur.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0041
# text = Plans are to build a private pipeline to Equilon's West Delta #143 platform and then bring the oil onshore.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0042
# text = Peggy is finding out where WD #143 pumps to onshore.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0043
# text = Tom's group would like to know if we have any interesting in buying the crude on either a fixed or floating basis.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0044
# text = The floating could be tied to a Platt's index or the NYMEX.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0045
# text = It is far too early to expect Murphy to enter into a physical or financial contract, but Tom hopes to get us first and/or last look from Murphy when the time is right.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0046
# text = Another alternative is to give Murphy barrels at their 95,000 bpd Meraux, Louisiana refinery in exchange for the new production barrels.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0047
# text = Could someone in your group please give me a notional non binding basis differential for this quality of crude for Cal 2003?

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0056
# text = following up on our discussion yesterday; for these types of deals, i dont think its necessary to have all the documentation of our counterparty's authorization to enter into the agreement.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0057
# text = these are short term transactions and requiring this documentation will cause us to lose business because competitive alternatives do not have such burdensome requirements.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0058
# text = the primary reason we need these things is for the scenario where a muni does a derivative deal with an open-ended downside, loses $50 million, and then claims that it was not a valid contract.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0059
# text = in our case, they are only hedging.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0060
# text = we are collecting a premium up front and their total cost is known up front.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0061
# text = therefore they will not attempt to make this claim.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0062
# text = even if they did, our risk is limited to the premium , not some big payout.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0063
# text = the risk of losing business is far greater than the risk of a counterparty trying to get their premium back.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0064
# text = seems like a 5 second decision to me.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0065
# text = is it possible to combine the standard isda and our confirm into a single long form?

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0066
# text = by going away from the standard isda maybe we can eliminate these requirements because the payout liability is only 1-way.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0089
# text = The mother was running late for work and could not wait.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0090
# text = I couldn't say no...so Nicki (the little girl-10 yrs. old) and I waited for the bus.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0091
# text = It was now, 8:15 and there was no sign of her bus.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0092
# text = On top of things, I had quiz at 8am.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0093
# text = Which I then realized I missed.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0094
# text = I decided that Nicki would just have to wait on her own.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0095
# text = I asked her if she had any relatives that would want to know of her whereabouts.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0096
# text = I called her grandmother and explained things to her.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0097
# text = Pretty strange...aye.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0098
# text = A bus that runs through UofH arrived and I almost got on without her, but I couldn't do it.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0099
# text = Finally, I told the little girl that she would have to accompany me to school (8:30am).

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0100
# text = There were only 15 minutes left of class.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0101
# text = I stayed for the remainder of the lecture.

# sent_id = email-enronsent37_01-0102

# text = Marianne: The following are my comments:

# sent_id = email-enronsent38_01-0002
# text = 1. In Section 1.1, there should be a parentheses after etc. in the 5th line.

# sent_id = email-enronsent38_01-0003
# text = 2. In Section 3.1, in the last sentence after the proviso insert "a" before the word "change" and after the word "in".

# sent_id = email-enronsent38_01-0006
# text = 4. In Section 6.2.1 I'll just note that the discount rate sentence I think is still an open issue.

# sent_id = email-enronsent38_01-0007
# text = 5. In Section 6.3, clause (c) should be reworded to fit with the language in the beginning of the Section.

# sent_id = email-enronsent38_01-0008
# text = 6. Capitalize the word "facility" in the definition of Average Annual Load Factor.

# sent_id = email-enronsent38_01-0009
# text = 7. Delete the definition of Costs as it is already defined in Section 6.2.1.

# sent_id = email-enronsent38_01-0010
# text = 8. Where is the defined term Govt Authority used?

# sent_id = email-enronsent38_01-0011
# text = 9. In the GTC, the ECP rep should also apply to EESI.

# sent_id = email-enronsent38_01-0012
# text = Also, in the 7th line of the reps add the word "into" after the word "entered" and before the word "this".

# sent_id = email-enronsent38_01-0013
# text = 10. In Collateral Requests, insert a comma after deposit in the last line.

# sent_id = email-enronsent38_01-0014
# text = I will also add granting/perfection language.

# sent_id = email-enronsent38_01-0015
# text = 11. In Events of Default, clause (a) refers to a dispute section which I'm not sure exists.

# sent_id = email-enronsent38_01-0016
# text = In clause (e), delete the "s": from the word consolidation.

# sent_id = email-enronsent38_01-0017

The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of our midmarket forms anticipate that we will act as customer's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to T&D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and pass those amounts on to the customer's utility.

# sent_id = email-enronsent38_01-0028
# text = 2. I did not include a "Setoff" provision in this draft, mainly because the vast majority of the time, we will not, nor will an affiliate, have another agreement in place with these customers.

# sent_id = email-enronsent38_01-0029
# text = If you feel strongly about our including a setoff provision, we will do so.

# sent_id = email-enronsent38_01-0030
# text = 3. The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh (and we've had great difficulty selling it in the past).

# sent_id = email-enronsent38_01-0031
# text = Taking into consideration this class of customer, we decided to include certain items, including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or practices as a "force majeure event" in an effort to soften the approach (see the GTCs).

# sent_id = email-enronsent38_01-0032
# text = Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again, more in the interest of "saving space" than anything else...

# text = A state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0025
# text = The investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: "the palace coup."

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0026
# text = Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0027
# text = The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0028
# text = Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0029
# text = "I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort," said Dunn.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0030
# text = The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0031
# text = Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "betrayed" by the actions of Winter.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0032
# text = "The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis," Maviglio said.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0033
# text = Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0034
# text = ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0035
# text = The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0036
# text = At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0037
# text = "It was an emergency," Fishman said.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0038
# text = "We had to take action.''

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0039
# text = What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0040
# text = The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0041
# text = "They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much," said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0042
# text = "All hell broke loose.''

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0043
# text = Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0044
# text = The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0045
# text = "If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0046
# text = Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0047
# text = He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "fix" prices, which would violate federal trade laws.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0048
# text = In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0049
# text = The generators got their way.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0050
# text = The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0051
# text = What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0052
# text = Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0053
# text = They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0054
# text = What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0055
# text = Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0056
# text = Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0057
# text = Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0058
# text = In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0059
# text = He didn't mention anything about it.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0060
# text = "In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0061
# text = With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0062
# text = "The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0063
# text = "It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0064
# text = This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business."

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0065
# text = Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0066
# text = Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0067
# text = Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0068
# text = Prices, he said, did not spike as a result.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0069
# text = Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0070
# text = Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0071
# text = "We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0072
# text = "In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0073
# text = We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund."

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0074
# text = Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0075
# text = Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0076
# text = "Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0077
# text = "He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing."

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0078
# text = The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0079
# text = Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0080
# text = James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0081
# text = "They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0082
# text = "They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do."

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0083
# text = What Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0084
# text = He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0085
# text = "We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out," Dunn said.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0086
# text = "Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0087
# text = We should resurrect Mike Smith's note and get him on the call in the attempt to avoid recreating the wheel on this one.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0088

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0091
# text = Can we discuss this today or soon thereafter.

# sent_id = email-enronsent07_01-0092

# text = That is what is about to happen with Judge Samuel Alito, in my opinion, because he has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in his thinking - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of Supreme Court Justice: He does not really agree with the system of "Checks and Balances" built into the Constitution, and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the "Unitary Executive Theory," which calls for vastly-increased Presidential Power at the expense of Congress and the Supreme Court.

# sent_id = newsgroup-groups.google.com_civicamerican_22c54c292026bfd2_ENG_20060128_072400-0026

# sent_id = newsgroup-groups.google.com_civicamerican_22c54c292026bfd2_ENG_20060128_072400-0029

# sent_id = newsgroup-groups.google.com_civicamerican_22c54c292026bfd2_ENG_20060128_072400-0030
# text = But Samuel Alito believes in a little-known Constitutional theory - called the "Unitary Executive Theory" - which says that the President should have complete control over the Executive Branch, and that the Executive Branch should be in charge of almost everything that the Government actually does, including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control, and the Military, which exists, which is regulated, and which is funded by specific authority given by the Constitution to Congress, not to the President.

# sent_id = newsgroup-groups.google.com_civicamerican_22c54c292026bfd2_ENG_20060128_072400-0034

# sent_id = answers-20111108110012AAK8Azy_ans-0011
# text = Let me try to break this down as simply as I can: diurnal (active during the day time) reptiles like the bearded dragon require 3 types of "light," UVA, UVB, and heat.

# sent_id = answers-20111108110012AAK8Azy_ans-0012
# text = Any white light emitting light source will emit UVA, including heat bulbs, that's the easy one to provide for.

# sent_id = answers-20111108110012AAK8Azy_ans-0013
# text = UVB on the other hand can only be reproduced by a fluorescent source.

# sent_id = answers-20111108110012AAK8Azy_ans-0014
# text = UVB will always be a separate bulb from the heat lamp, unless you use a MVB (mercury vapor bulb) which is the only reptile use bulb that will emit both UVB and heat from one bulb.

# sent_id = answers-20111108110012AAK8Azy_ans-0015
# text = I highly recommend that you do not use coiled/compact UVB bulbs as they are known to cause severe eye damage and/or blindness in reptiles not to mention they have trouble maintaining UVB output over time.

# sent_id = answers-20111108110012AAK8Azy_ans-0016
# text = The long tube UVB bulbs are best, like Zoomed's Repsitun model: http://lllreptile.com/store/catalog/reptile-supplies/uvb-fluorescent-lights-mercury-vapor-bulbs/-/zoo-med-24-repti-sun-100-fluorescent-bulb/ Remember to replace UVB bulbs according to the manufacturers recommendation after which time the bulb will no longer produce UVB even if visible light still is.

# sent_id = answers-20111108110012AAK8Azy_ans-0017
# text = So, to answer your question, no, if you just have a bulb that says it produces UVA then you do not have "the sun's rays" that your bearded needs.

# sent_id = answers-20111108110012AAK8Azy_ans-0018

# sent_id = answers-20111108110012AAK8Azy_ans-0031

# sent_id = reviews-342807-0004
# text = Anyway, I was practically raised on this stuff, and being a connoisseur of West Indian cuisine, Jamaica Way is a bit toned down to suit the American palette.

# sent_id = reviews-342807-0005

# sent_id = reviews-077298-0003
# text = I normally don't write reviews but seeing that I considered Dillards a distinguished, upscale place to shop, this one won't be getting my business, nor my family's, nor my co-workers.

# sent_id = reviews-077298-0004

# sent_id = reviews-165143-0004
# text = The service was just about as good as I'd get in NYC (that means it was poor) and the food was almost mediocre.

# sent_id = reviews-165143-0005
# text = The decor left a lot to be desired and the posters telling me all the reasons 99 was great just served as an ironic contrast against the reality.

# text = In my experience the food has been excellent (for the most part).

# sent_id = reviews-231203-0006
# text = However, the bartenders/waitresses definately need to be re-trained (if they ever had any to begin with) and learn two things: only chat with customers when other customers are not impatiently waiting and to look around more often to see if people are waiting.

# sent_id = reviews-231203-0007
# text = In some cases the result is because of understaffing, in some cases the staff just doesn't care/know better.

# sent_id = reviews-231203-0008
# text = They must also get something to keep take-out warm, so it's not room temperature at best when you get it home.

# sent_id = reviews-070730-0002
# text = Additionally we tried the Logan Circle roll, spicy crab and tuna roll, and sweet potato tempura roll ($15, $10, and $3.75 respectively).

# sent_id = reviews-070730-0003
# text = The sweet potato tempura roll was actually a great surprise: cheap and delicious, the only thing we tried that I would say was well worth it and a great value (and I never get vegetarian rolls).

# sent_id = reviews-070730-0004
# text = The other rolls weren't at all special, especially given their pricing.

# sent_id = reviews-070730-0005
# text = The bottom line is that the food isn't great and is relatively high-priced.

# sent_id = reviews-070730-0006
# text = The service is solicitous, the atmosphere is nice and mod except the out-of-place flat-screen TV playing football.

# text = After checking for signs of fire or smoke and seeing none, I decided to just pack up and leave.

# sent_id = reviews-020992-0008
# text = The desk agent actually argued with me, claiming that no such alarm had gone off (as if I would make that up?).

# sent_id = reviews-020992-0009
# text = He finally admitted that only the 4 ADA room alarms had sounded, so only 4 guests were effected (no big deal to him).

# sent_id = reviews-020992-0010

# sent_id = reviews-288100-0003
# text = The poor quality starts at the receptionist desk, where the staff is very impatient and lack the efficiency I once loved about the office.

# sent_id = reviews-288100-0004
# text = It took them nearly two months to complete a simple task, and countless calls from my part due to their lack of response and passion (not that it's a requirement for the job, but it helps to at least pretend to be helpful).

# sent_id = reviews-288100-0005
# text = Also, I was promised to have my test results emailed to me, but it never happened, and after a few attempts to get Dr. Romanick on the phone to brief me on my condition, I finally gave up and went to a different doctor.

# sent_id = reviews-288100-0006

# sent_id = reviews-363873-0006
# text = Then, when we moved out, we cleaned the apartment top to bottom, they came back and tried to charge us for two cleaning fees (and we never got our deposit back) and past utilities (that were already paid, we have check numbers and records of this).

# sent_id = reviews-363873-0007
# text = Linda is the rudest person you will ever talk to and she sticks up for all of the trashy, rude people that live there, not the nice ones that actually give a crap about respecting others.

# sent_id = reviews-162422-0008
# text = Sure enough he charged it to the credit card.

# sent_id = reviews-162422-0009
# text = When I inquired he rudely replied "in the morning when things are checked out you'll get it back."

# sent_id = reviews-162422-0010

# sent_id = reviews-398243-0006
# text = He checked out what I needed to have done told me what needed be fixed before he did any work and did great repair work.

# sent_id = reviews-398243-0007
# text = The price was actually lower than what I had anticipated and used to compared to other places, plus he showed me the work he did when I came into pick up the car.

# sent_id = reviews-398243-0008
# text = Also, a week after the work, Phet called me up to see how my car was running and to let me know that they had accidentally overcharged me for part of the work and wanted to give me a refund for that amount.

# sent_id = reviews-398243-0009
# text = That is just unheard of these days!

# sent_id = reviews-398243-0010
# text = I grew up in a small town where you knew and trusted your mechanic and was really cynical about city auto repair shops since I moved here, but Phet has shown that there really are honest hard working mechanics around.

# sent_id = reviews-398243-0011
# text = He is my mechanic going forward!

# sent_id = reviews-278775-0001
# text = Our company is a high end designer handbag and fashion accessories company, thus we are certainly a niche market.

# sent_id = reviews-278775-0002
# text = We had been evaluating SEO providers for quite some time and finally decided to take the plunge with Stuart, and Ulistic.

# sent_id = reviews-278775-0003
# text = We made the decision for a couple of reasons.

# sent_id = reviews-278775-0004
# text = 1. Social Media.

# sent_id = reviews-278775-0005
# text = We were familiar with Search Engine Optimization strategies, but new nothing about Social Media - we just heard that it was the next big thing.

# sent_id = reviews-278775-0006
# text = 2. We really liked the fact that Stuart sets defined objectives and we meet once a month to go over our Key Performance Indicators.

# sent_id = reviews-278775-0007
# text = How has it gone so far?

# sent_id = reviews-278775-0008
# text = Well we have been working with Ulistic for 1.5 months, and have 100 people following our site on Facebook, and our web site, www.designofashion.com has seen a 3 fold increase in traffic, which is significantly beating our expectations - SEO is a process that takes time and to get results this quickly is exceptional.

# sent_id = reviews-278775-0009
# text = We are absolutely confident that Stuart's ethical and focused strategies will see these trends continue to grow, and our business will reap the rewards of this program.

# sent_id = reviews-278775-0010

# sent_id = reviews-117115-0007
# text = The window didn't break!

# sent_id = reviews-117115-0008

# sent_id = reviews-117115-0009
# text = I called Home-Excel the next day to order a replacement screen for the window, and was happily surprised when they said that they weren't even going to charge me for the replacement screen...that it would be covered under their guarentee.

# sent_id = reviews-117115-0010
# text = Lo and behold, they replaced the screen (which had to be ordered) yesterday and didn't charge me a dime.

# sent_id = reviews-342811-0011
# text = A mid-afternoon "fire drill" was disruptive, putting everyone out of the hotel.

# sent_id = reviews-342811-0012
# text = When we called the front desk about an extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside our door quite late at night, it seemed to take the hotel staff quite a while to quiet them down.

# sent_id = reviews-342811-0013

# sent_id = reviews-181748-0003
# text = My experience was awful though.

# sent_id = reviews-181748-0004

# sent_id = reviews-181748-0005
# text = I was extremely interested in the car and very likely would have bought it, but the sales guy I dealt with ruined the deal.

# sent_id = reviews-181748-0006

# text = I don't know if the kid had a bad day or what, but I had to sit and apologize about nothing for 10 minutes until he dropped the issue.

# sent_id = reviews-181748-0009
# text = I played dumb and asked him questions that I already knew the answers to and he responded with half truths and a few falsehoods.

# sent_id = reviews-181748-0010
# text = For instance I asked who owned Mazda and he said with confidence that was GM, which isn't true.

# sent_id = reviews-181748-0011
# text = I mean, I don't care if he doesn't know, but if he pretends to know and tells me BS to my face, there's no way I'm going to trust him when matters turn to the price of the car and financing.

# text = So for the 4th time in 5 months and the third time in 2 weeks, we brought the car back again.

# sent_id = reviews-086839-0008
# text = When we expressed our discontent to the manager (that's right, the manager), did he say he would return some money, did he say he would give a discount on our next visit, did he just say "I'm sorry".

# sent_id = reviews-086839-0009
# text = Nope, none of the above.

# sent_id = reviews-086839-0010
# text = He stood there and told us how he wasn't at fault.

# sent_id = reviews-086839-0011
# text = It was the fault of the parts supplier, and can we imagine how he felt having to put another 2 hours of work in the car.

# sent_id = reviews-086839-0012
# text = And what did we expect...that he bench test every part.

# sent_id = reviews-086839-0013
# text = At no time during the conversation did the words, "I'm sorry" ever come out of his mouth.

# sent_id = reviews-086839-0014
# text = I, nor anyone else in my family, will ever go to Sun Devil Auto again.

# sent_id = reviews-345182-0010
# text = She told me she could not use the piece I was returning and the company would only put it in the trash so I could not return it.

# text = I explained I did not get what I paid for.

# sent_id = reviews-345182-0012
# text = She asked me to bring the original piece back and I told her I had to use it on the job.

# sent_id = reviews-345182-0013
# text = She told me that was to bad she would do nothing to help me since she could not use or resell the piece.

# sent_id = reviews-345182-0014
# text = I said I was going to trash it also and could I at least have a credit.

# sent_id = reviews-345182-0015
# text = With a smirk on her face she told me NO MONEY IS BEING RETURNED and THAT IS THE WAY IT WAS.

# text = Actually working out there was good - the machines are nice and the classes are fun.

# sent_id = reviews-071650-0005
# text = The locker room is certainly lacking - I would never shower or change there.

# sent_id = reviews-071650-0006
# text = They need to update the locker rooms ASAP.

# sent_id = reviews-071650-0007
# text = Back to my poor rating - I was excepted to medical school and went in to cancel my membership as I was told I could do since I was moving away.

# sent_id = reviews-071650-0008
# text = The owner was VERY rude, accused me of not reading my contract, and basically told me to shut up when I was trying to ask questions to further understand the process of canceling my membership.

# sent_id = reviews-071650-0009
# text = I was able to cancel it but only after paying a $50 fee (which the staff person who signed me up stated I would not have to pay if I had proof of moving) and being spoken to in a very belittling manner.

# sent_id = reviews-071650-0010
# text = I would understand if I was being treated this way by a staff member but the club's actual OWNER?!

# sent_id = reviews-071650-0011

# sent_id = reviews-018465-0003
# text = Right out of college I called the salon and explained my situation.

# sent_id = reviews-018465-0004
# text = Just graduated, just moved, not rich, and starting new job soon.

# sent_id = reviews-018465-0005
# text = I never got a price quote over the phone and they take your cc info just to make the appointment because if you don't show up, they'll charge you.

# sent_id = reviews-018465-0006
# text = I had this ridiculous celebrity stylist from LA named Derrick.

# sent_id = reviews-018465-0007

# sent_id = reviews-018465-0011
# text = $400 later my jaw dropped when the receptionist told me the total.

# sent_id = reviews-018465-0012
# text = Derrick did a terrible job, was a complete jerk the entire time, and I had no warning as to the price.

# sent_id = reviews-018465-0013
# text = I cried the entire way home.

# sent_id = reviews-018465-0014
# text = He then "fixed" it for free but it still looked like crap.

# sent_id = reviews-018465-0015
# text = I will never go back.

# sent_id = reviews-018465-0016
# text = It was the salon experience from absolutely Hell.

# sent_id = reviews-018465-0017
# text = He also told me that he worked on the cast of will and grace and that they were all jerks.

# sent_id = reviews-018465-0018
# text = That's my favorite show of all time.

# sent_id = reviews-018465-0019
# text = I'm pretty sure for the cast that it was the other way around.

# sent_id = reviews-018465-0020
# text = Maybe he didn't do a good job and they told him so.

# sent_id = reviews-018465-0021

# sent_id = reviews-333243-0002
# text = Working with Rod Jacobsen was my first experience working with a CPA, so I did not know what to expect.

# sent_id = reviews-333243-0003
# text = That said - he seemed to be doing well enough.

# sent_id = reviews-333243-0004
# text = However, then I asked to amend my return to apply a credit I had just become eligible for.

# sent_id = reviews-333243-0005
# text = I expected to pay for this service, but imagine my surprise when I received a bill for MORE than what I paid to have the original return prepared.

# sent_id = reviews-333243-0006
# text = Asked why, Rod simply told me that he had to research how to do the amendment (it was an amended to show that I had purchased a home - nothing out of the ordinary, one would think) and that took time to figure out.

# sent_id = reviews-333243-0007
# text = Well, that was strike one.

# sent_id = reviews-333243-0008
# text = I wasn't going to use them again, but I was going to leave it at that.

# sent_id = reviews-333243-0009
# text = However, now that I have come to realize that I am going to owe the IRS $6,000+ despite doing exactly what Rod told me to do, I feel I have to voice my opinion.

# sent_id = reviews-333243-0010
# text = Last year, after all was said and done, I asked Rod whether my payment structure would leave me with no/little tax liability at the end of the year.

# sent_id = reviews-333243-0011
# text = He said yes.

# sent_id = reviews-333243-0012
# text = Well, again, I am now faced with a tax bill of $6,000+, all due on April 15, 2010 and all that Rod has to say to the matter is 'well, you won't have to pay a penalty.'

# sent_id = reviews-333243-0013
# text = I may not have to pay a penalty, yet, but this is NOT what I had in mind when hired these guys.

# sent_id = reviews-036133-0002
# text = I bought about half of the furniture I own from this place.

# sent_id = reviews-036133-0003
# text = Why?

# sent_id = reviews-036133-0004
# text = Because they cut me good deals if I paid in cash.

# sent_id = reviews-036133-0005
# text = Sketchy, right?

# sent_id = reviews-036133-0006
# text = Well they came through and delivered almost all of my items within a few days.

# sent_id = reviews-036133-0007
# text = (They even got me a couch pretty quickly.)

# sent_id = reviews-036133-0008
# text = The guy who was cutting me the deals and getting me the furniture quickly, Ahmed, was nice and mostly professional, except the semi-sketchiness.

# sent_id = reviews-036133-0009
# text = Then one day, Ahmed left the country, not to return for months, WITHOUT informing me.

# sent_id = reviews-036133-0010
# text = He also neglected to tell the other person working at the store about a dining room table that I had ordered and that was supposed to be coming in.

# sent_id = reviews-036133-0011
# text = The other person working at the store didn't know that I still had this table coming.

# sent_id = reviews-036133-0012
# text = I had paid in cash, and he said he had no receipt/record of my purchase.

# sent_id = reviews-036133-0013
# text = I came back with the receipt Ahmed had provided upon my purchase, and the guy took forever to copy it but said that he would take care of the situation.

# sent_id = reviews-036133-0014
# text = I waited.

# sent_id = reviews-036133-0015
# text = And waited.

# sent_id = reviews-036133-0016
# text = He never once contacted us.

# sent_id = reviews-036133-0017
# text = I've had to pester this new guy several times to ask when my table will arrive.

# sent_id = reviews-036133-0018
# text = He kept saying different arrival/delivery dates and didn't seem terribly apologetic.

# text = If I could give them a lower rating than poor I would.

# sent_id = reviews-026883-0005
# text = On August 21st, 2009 I ordered furniture from Hickory Furniture Mart and contracted for HDS to deliver it.

# sent_id = reviews-026883-0006
# text = After seventeen days the delivery van showed up at my home minus two pieces.

# sent_id = reviews-026883-0007
# text = I was later told they had been left at the warehouse and some future date they would be delivered.

# sent_id = reviews-026883-0008
# text = No one will give me a date.

# sent_id = reviews-026883-0009
# text = I spent $2300 on the bedroom suite, which was complete and excellent condition on the showroom floor.

# sent_id = reviews-026883-0010
# text = Upon delivery it was clear the entire set was damaged: a piece of wood was broke on the headboard; the chest of drawers was missing all four pieces necessary to attach the legs; the dresser back legs were pushed in causing the dresser to lean into the wall; and a nighstand was missing a drawer.

# sent_id = reviews-026883-0011
# text = How do you lose a drawer.

# sent_id = reviews-026883-0012
# text = After complaining on September 10th to National Home Furnishings, Boyles, the Hickory Furniture Mart and Home Delivery Service the latter finally called me back and said they would be up to pick the dresser and chest of drawers at some future point and at some later point it would be professional repaired and at some later point it would be returned.

# sent_id = reviews-026883-0013
# text = The customer service at Home Delivery Service was terrible let alone their promise to proper set up furniture.

# sent_id = reviews-026883-0014
# text = So I am in limbo regarding a bedroom suite.

# sent_id = reviews-026883-0015
# text = I hope the owners and employees of this store have broken bedroom suites in their homes and furniture sitting in someone's warehouse.

# sent_id = reviews-026883-0016
# text = Maybe then they will begin to understand poor customer service and terrible sit up service.

# sent_id = reviews-048363-0004
# text = A very good friend of mine highly recommended the Professional Driving School and I was told to specifically ask for Gerry.

# sent_id = reviews-048363-0005
# text = She highly recommended him and described him as the "Saintly Instructor and Simply the Best Instructor there is ....very calm, pleasant and very detailed in giving instructions".

# sent_id = reviews-048363-0006
# text = I called the school most probably 10 times before I finally enrolled in a 20 hour package.

# sent_id = reviews-048363-0007
# text = I had to cancel my initial lesson 4 times and on the 5th attempt the management was quick enough to associate my cancellations with my fear and finally encouraged me into taking my initial lesson.

# sent_id = reviews-048363-0008
# text = Five minutes before my initial lesson, I got a call from Gerry advising me of his arrival and to come down as soon as I was ready.

# sent_id = reviews-048363-0009
# text = My heart pounded as I walked down and pounded even faster upon seeing Gerry in an SUV - Lexus!

# sent_id = reviews-048363-0010
# text = I thought of canceling the lesson once again because I didn't feel comfortable driving an SUV.

# sent_id = reviews-048363-0011
# text = Gerry pleasantly said " since I am already here why don't we give it shot.

# sent_id = reviews-048363-0012
# text = I trust you and believe that you'll be able to handle this and all you have to do is to reciprocate!

# sent_id = reviews-160073-0003
# text = Well it took us a while to find one that we liked.

# sent_id = reviews-160073-0004
# text = But we don't just like House of Joy WE LOVE IT.

# sent_id = reviews-160073-0005
# text = Everything we have gotten there has been more authentic and better tasting than any other Chinese restaurant in the San Antonio area we have been to--and trust me we have been to a lot of them.

# sent_id = reviews-160073-0006
# text = We just happen to stumble across this little restaurant one day when we had to visit the Bexar County Tax Office off of Bandera Road.

# sent_id = reviews-160073-0007
# text = We stopped in and got some take out and cannot stop going back.

# sent_id = reviews-160073-0008
# text = They have the best Egg Drop Soup I have ever tasted.

# sent_id = reviews-160073-0009
# text = We also love their Egg Rolls and Spring Rolls.

# sent_id = reviews-160073-0010
# text = And every entree we have ordered is perfect.

# sent_id = reviews-160073-0011
# text = Everything is always cooked fresh and tastes fresh.

# sent_id = reviews-160073-0012
# text = Their prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you receive.

# sent_id = reviews-160073-0013
# text = The staff is also just so pleasant to deal with.

# sent_id = reviews-160073-0014

# sent_id = reviews-160073-0015
# text = You don't have to sit and wait around forever like most places!!

# sent_id = reviews-160073-0016

# sent_id = reviews-160073-0020
# text = We are from Virginia and just moved here a year ago.

# sent_id = reviews-160073-0021
# text = So that comment is completely false.

# sent_id = reviews-160073-0022

# sent_id = reviews-148971-0002
# text = I am not sure about the quality of the other doctors there, but i do know from personal experience that Dr. Christopher T. Strzalka is not a man of his word, and is also very CRUEL AND UNCARING!!

# sent_id = reviews-148971-0003
# text = He was going to operate and replace my bicuspid aortic valve due to critical aortic stenosis.

# sent_id = reviews-148971-0004
# text = I had a surgery date of July 17, 2008.

# sent_id = reviews-148971-0005
# text = Then he renigged when he read my Health Care Proxy, even though i agreed to be on the ventilator for 2 months following surgery (as he had twice stated i must agree to).

# sent_id = reviews-148971-0006
# text = He later said that by 2 months he "meant at least two months".

# sent_id = reviews-148971-0007
# text = Two months and at least two months are totally different things.

# sent_id = reviews-148971-0008
# text = He did not even give me the chance to say i would stay on the ventilator longer, which i would have.

# sent_id = reviews-148971-0009
# text = A Health Care Proxy is not written in stone and can be changed.

# sent_id = reviews-148971-0010
# text = He also never even said he was sorry.

# sent_id = reviews-148971-0011
# text = Just said i was inoperable and walked out of the hospital room.

# sent_id = reviews-148971-0012
# text = So, therefore, now he says i am inoperable (even though i am not 100% inoperable), and he is letting me die.

# sent_id = reviews-148971-0013
# text = I am just middle aged and do not want to die, but thanks to this doctor i have no other alternatives.

# sent_id = reviews-148971-0014
# text = I, along with my friends, consider this doctor to be the cause of my death as he is not even trying to save my life by operating.

# sent_id = reviews-148971-0015
# text = Even my PA i went to the other day said "it must by comforting to have gone to a heart surgeon like him who will do nothing for you".

# sent_id = reviews-148971-0016
# text = He said it sarcastically.

# sent_id = reviews-148971-0017
# text = If you want a doctor who will lie to you and say he will operate and then change his mind, and not know what he is talking about when he recommends procedures at other hospitals and says they are what you need, when they will not work for you, go to this doctor...he is the one for you.

# newdoc id = reviews-290594
# sent_id = reviews-290594-0001
# text = What you can learn from the below 'bad experience'.

# sent_id = reviews-290594-0002
# text = I would suggest not avoiding Second Home based on the 'bad experience' review.

# sent_id = reviews-290594-0003
# text = I'd probably be more inclined to board my two dogs here, seeing that they don't just take every dog coming in.

# sent_id = reviews-290594-0004
# text = I've toured this place and was impressed by how clean the place was, and all the options for the dogs.

# sent_id = reviews-290594-0005
# text = It's unfortunate that bmil believed that his 'perfect' dog was not given the right opportunity to prove himself.

# sent_id = reviews-290594-0006
# text = But I've done hundreds of dog introductions myself (another place, I don't work here), and owners can have unrealistic expectations and views of what they see when their dogs meet other dogs.

# sent_id = reviews-290594-0007
# text = Workers who do these introductions look at the interaction objectively; and it's good to see they are able and willing to say no if they feel there would be a problem.

# sent_id = reviews-290594-0008
# text = It sounds (according to your own statement) that they had a roomful of dogs, so they must be doing something right - and are keeping those dogs safe from potential problems.

# sent_id = reviews-290594-0009
# text = You say you work a lot, and that you have a young dog; so I have little doubt that your dog is just filled with energy to burn; and it is good of you to look for a place to take him.

# sent_id = reviews-290594-0010
# text = But not at a risk to other people's pets.

# sent_id = reviews-290594-0011
# text = You were clearly given another alternative by Second Home, to board him - which might have given your dog a chance to come and go from Second Home a couple times, getting used to the place and maybe facilitating another attempt to get into daycare later.

# sent_id = reviews-290594-0012
# text = No business is going to push customers away without good reason; so isn't it reasonable to think they might know what they're doing?

# sent_id = reviews-290594-0013
# text = My dogs are far from perfect, and one of them I believe would be a little much for daycare here herself (at least initially).

# sent_id = reviews-290594-0014
# text = Be a little more reasonable with your expectations of a place like this; and maybe don't jump to personal attacks suggesting that they don't want to work hard, just because you bruised your own ego.

# sent_id = reviews-351561-0014

# sent_id = reviews-351561-0016

# sent_id = reviews-351561-0017
# text = Yes, I say.

# sent_id = reviews-351561-0018
# text = 17th, like over by 16th and 15th YES, I say, one mile west of you.

# sent_id = reviews-351561-0019
# text = You're at 7th.

# sent_id = reviews-351561-0020

# sent_id = reviews-351561-0021
# text = She says, Is that 17th like over past broad.

# sent_id = reviews-351561-0022

# sent_id = reviews-351561-0024
# text = Hmmm, she says, Then why are you calling here, we don't go past broad?

# sent_id = reviews-351561-0025

# sent_id = reviews-043020-0002
# text = B&B came out very quickly to give us our quote back in June.

# sent_id = reviews-043020-0003
# text = They were very polite, eager to answer any questions and willing to wait for us to return from vacation to begin installing our fence.

# sent_id = reviews-043020-0004
# text = Our fence was installed quickly in August and they had their money and left saying "Workmanship is guaranteed for a year!".

# sent_id = reviews-043020-0005
# text = Within a week we noticed one of the boards on our gate splitting where a nail had gone in.

# sent_id = reviews-043020-0006
# text = We called our representative who assured me he would call the office and have it taken care of.

# sent_id = reviews-043020-0007
# text = We heard nothing.

# sent_id = reviews-043020-0008
# text = We then called the office and the man we spoke to said he'd send someone out to look at it but couldn't promise when- two weeks came and went and we heard nothing.

# sent_id = reviews-043020-0009
# text = I just called again and was told that workmanship, not wood, is guaranteed for a year- well in my opinion- the wood split due to a nail which is part of workmanship!

# sent_id = reviews-043020-0010
# text = She even went so far as to say "Your calling about one board?"

# sent_id = reviews-043020-0011
# text = Well- when you pay over $1000 for something you want it to hold up and look good!!!

# sent_id = reviews-043020-0012
# text = YES!

# sent_id = reviews-043020-0013
# text = I WAS calling about one board!!

# sent_id = reviews-043020-0014
# text = I'm very frustrated at this point- it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked (the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through) yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once WAS a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer.

# sent_id = reviews-043020-0015
# text = So I figure if they don't want to take the time to fix the fence that they installed then I'll take the time to let everyone I can know about how they treat customers once they have your money!!!

# sent_id = reviews-043020-0016
# text = STAY AWAY!!!

# sent_id = reviews-043020-0017
# text = YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!

# sent_id = reviews-043020-0018
# text = They came in under a lot of other quotes and now I know why!!!

# sent_id = reviews-043020-0019
# text = When the fence was first installed I would have given them five stars, now for their poor customer follow-up and unwillingness to fix the fence they have dropped to a one-star in my opinion!

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0002

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0003
# text = I then called the 800 number (which was answered) and inquired about last minute rates.

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0004

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0005
# text = The room was supposed to be on the 2nd floor, but they put us on the 3rd.

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0006
# text = The email confirmation (which I read in the car) warned about large suitcases, declaring that we are innkeepers, not longshoreman.

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0007
# text = In other words, they do not help with suitcases, but they promise totes to help.

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0008
# text = However upon our arrival no one there (the inn was open).

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0009
# text = So no totes.

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0010
# text = Finally a chambermaid stuck her head around the corner from the top of the stairs and told us sternly that we could not be accommodated until 3M, no exceptions.

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0011
# text = Then she was gone.

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0012

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0013
# text = Rules in the room: #1) if you drink the soda from the fridge in your room you must prove it by leaving the can in the trash.

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0014
# text = If they think you've taken a soda from your room home with you, they will charge you $1.50 per can.

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0015
# text = They count the cans in the trash to make sure.

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0016
# text = #2) If you take the shampoo products home, they will charge you $8 per item.

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0018
# text = #4) Breakfast is 8AM to 10AM.

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0019

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0020
# text = If you go later, it's all cleaned up.

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0021

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0022

# text = Snacks: uninspired bread, tea backs, and individual coffee things for a machine that didn't exist.

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0025

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0026
# text = No wine glasses.

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0027
# text = Room was clean, but had a weird, dated, sink/stove combo that didn't work.

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0028
# text = Bath was clean except shower stall which had mildew problems.

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0029
# text = No tub.

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0030
# text = The Inn touts a shower with dual shower heads, but only one worked.

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0031
# text = Don't get the rooms off the two kitchens.

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0032

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0033
# text = Free parking.

# sent_id = reviews-363685-0034

# newdoc id = reviews-053248
# sent_id = reviews-053248-0001
# text = Quit with the overstatements!

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0002
# text = The worst thing that can happen for any restaurant like Zahav is to have too many people write hyperbolic reviews making claims that "everyone" is going to "love" the food, decor and service.

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0003
# text = The truth is, in my and my dining partners' experience, this is a fine little restaurant with some unique food.

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0004
# text = It's an entirely up and down experience, however.

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0005
# text = Now, the best of that unique food comes at the very beginning of the meal.

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0006
# text = The salatim salads are the smallest plates I've ever seen placed in front of me (you would most likely think they were condiments if it weren't explained to you).

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0007
# text = Though they are mostly excellent, you generally don't get enough forkfuls to know if you really love them.

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0008
# text = That being said, the laffa and hummus are out of this world.

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0009
# text = Then again, for the three of us who dined together, two pieces of flatbread left us fighting for more, and licking the hummus from our fingers (and yes, those two pieces of flatbread did represent a three-person order).

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0010
# text = Dinner was also an up-and-down experience.

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0011
# text = The vegetarian dishes and lighter fare were almost always spot-on, while the lamb was often dry and/or overcooked.

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0012
# text = The duck was a 65% glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy, crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments.

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0013
# text = Dessert was... hmmm, that's interesting, I don't even remember dessert.

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0014
# text = I guess that tells you a lot.

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0015
# text = Oh, yes, the chocolate semifreddo was quite good.

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0016
# text = The warm chocolate cake was very tasty, but served at room temperature, not warm by any stretch of the imagination.

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0017
# text = And my--no, I still don't remember what I had.

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0018
# text = Service was average, but nothing special, and restaurants that are supposed to be excellent should do a better job of training their waitstaff to be communicative and friendly, not merely capable.

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0019
# text = Perhaps had we not gone into this restaurant believing Zahav was going to be golden as its name suggests (and as the many golden reviews seem to attest), we would have enjoyed a decent little expensive experience.

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0020
# text = But one should not go here expecting something fantastic, unless perhaps you've never had middle-eastern food before, or succulent duck, tasty lamb, decent portion sizes or actually warm chocolate desserts.

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0021
# text = PS) When we called for a reservation, we were told that 5:00 and 9:30 were their only openings.

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0022
# text = When we arrived at 5, and left circa 7, there were the same 4 or 5 empty tables surrounding us.

# sent_id = reviews-053248-0023
# text = Did they think we were going to feel lucky to get any reservation at all, and therefore be more pleased with our dining experience?

# newdoc id = reviews-211797
# sent_id = reviews-211797-0001
# text = MUST READ - Do not waste your time in this store.

# sent_id = reviews-211797-0002
# text = At my appointment the girl helping me was unable to adequately lace up some of the dresses.

# sent_id = reviews-211797-0003
# text = They felt like they were going to fall off of me and it was very difficult to see what I would actually look like were I to purchase some of these dresses.

# sent_id = reviews-211797-0004
# text = I thought it would be a good idea to see how a few that I liked would look like on a model (by looking the dress up online).

# sent_id = reviews-211797-0005
# text = So, as I was leaving I asked for the designer/dress name or style number associated with my top picks.

# sent_id = reviews-211797-0006
# text = They said they were "unable to tell me until they ordered my dress".

# sent_id = reviews-211797-0007
# text = Hmmm... A person cannot call a company, if you have no idea its name (since the designer is unknown... SUPPOSEDLY), and order a gown without a dress name or style number.

# sent_id = reviews-211797-0008
# text = Do other brides fall for this???

# sent_id = reviews-211797-0009
# text = They either: a) don't want to give it to me because they don't want me purchasing the dress elsewhere or b) are recreating the dresses themselves (ie STEALING other designers' dress designs and "filling the orders" by their own seamstresses).

# sent_id = reviews-211797-0010
# text = I'm no detective but... uhh... seriously?!?

# sent_id = reviews-211797-0011
# text = Whatever type of operation they are running, I'm not interested and if you're smart, you won't be either.

# sent_id = reviews-211797-0012
# text = What a waste of TIME.

# sent_id = reviews-211797-0013
# text = Aside from that little *mystery*, one of the sales ladies was quite comfortable telling me how wrong I was about how another dress that I loved compared to one of her dresses that I was trying on.

# sent_id = reviews-211797-0014
# text = Somehow, since she supposedly doesn't know any names of designers/dresses, after I told her the designer and dress name of the one I was comparing, she knew "exactly which dress" I was referring to and disagreed with my observation; she said that the bodice did come as low as the one I had on.

# sent_id = reviews-211797-0015
# text = My point: Even if I was wrong, don't sit there and argue with the customer.

# sent_id = reviews-211797-0016
# text = Say something like, "Huh.

# sent_id = reviews-211797-0017
# text = I didn't think so but you could be right."

# sent_id = reviews-211797-0018
# text = Unless you want to take the "tell the customer how wrong she is and try and force her into a dress she's obviously not loving" approach which will likely get you... uh... nowhere.

# sent_id = reviews-211797-0019
# text = Seriously: do not waste your time.

# sent_id = reviews-211797-0020
# text = Other shops around this city have MUCH NICER and more TRANSPARENT owners.

# sent_id = reviews-211797-0021
# text = Not owners that seem like they have something to hide and know nothing about common courtesy and customer service.

# sent_id = reviews-211797-0022
# text = I felt very much like Wedding Gallery was being dishonest and I wouldn't trust them to lace me up in another gown let alone trust them with the gown I will wear on the most important day of my life.

# newdoc id = reviews-319816
# sent_id = reviews-319816-0001
# text = AWFUL SERVICE!

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0002
# text = After happily visiting Sear's Automotives in the past, I was shocked at the horrible service received at their Greensboro location.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0003
# text = I brought my car in on a Sunday to replace a shredded tire.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0004
# text = I waited about 20 minutes in the store part before anyone was able to assist me and was then told to pull my car into the shop (that is apparently what you are supposed to do, but the big signs pointing you that way are for some reason kept inside the garage, so you don't see them drving up, and they purposely block the front pull-up that all other Sear's use).

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0005
# text = Once inside, I had to stand around for at least 10 more minutes before--FINALLY-- a technician got to me.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0006
# text = Once I returned to pick up my car, you can believe I spent quite a bit MORE time standing around waiting.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0007
# text = I had wanted to split the total between a credit card and check card since I was being reimbursed for the tire but was told this wasn't possible.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0008
# text = Once I actually got back in my car, it was dirty and had grease all over the steering wheel.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0009
# text = OK, one bad experience...fine.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0010
# text = The following Friday, I returned with my car to go ahead and replace the other 3 tires, which were worn.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0011
# text = I would not have gone back, but I couldn't find the particular tire they'd used in stock anywhere else.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0012
# text = Once again, I waited for quite a bit before being attended to.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0013
# text = I got the order completed, and then questioned the technician since it came out about $40 less than I expected.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0014
# text = He said it was the same tire, and verified this, after checking both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0015
# text = However, when he printed out the service quote, I could see that it was NOT the correct tire, and was not even an appropriate tire for my car model.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0016
# text = So I pointed this out to him, at which point he said they only had one of the correct tires in stock.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0017
# text = Ok--fine.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0018
# text = So I got just my other rear tire replaced.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0019
# text = They promised it'd be done within an hour, so I waited in the lobby.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0020
# text = Over two hours later (and ten minutes before they closed) my car was finally finished.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0021
# text = A few minutes after I left, I was called and informed that "I" left my wheel lock (which they should have left in the car).

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0022
# text = Of course, they would be closing in 5 minutes, so I would have to hurry up or get it the next day.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0023
# text = Of course I couldn't make it back in time (and they apparently could not stay 5 extra minutes to wait for me).

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0024
# text = The next day, no one could find my wheel lock and that particular technician was not in.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0025
# text = Of course, they couldn't call him either to ask about it because apparently they don't keep their employees' phone numbers (riiight), so I would have to return on Monday (driving for 3 days now with no wheel lock should I get a flat).

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0026
# text = On Monday I called and again it was a big to-do to find anyone who knew anything about it.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0027
# text = Supposedly they will be holding it for me this evening, but I'm sure that will also be a huge ordeal.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0028
# text = The employees at this Sear's are completely apathetic and there didn't seem to be any sort of management that I could see.

# sent_id = reviews-319816-0029
# text = I will never return there again (and now have some serious doubts about the quality of work they actually performed on my car).
